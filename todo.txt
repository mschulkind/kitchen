-clicking login with google shows the dashboard, then if I refresh, I go back to logged out.
-what is regular login? I don't see tha tanywhere and I didn't think we were supposed to have it.
-whuile the dashboard buttons work, there's no indication for the mouse that they are buttons
-I want to organize the non-perishable stuff around things that are just regularly kept in stock, so I don't want to have ot track an inventory of what is in the pantry exactly, I just want to log that it is something that I keep around, so you should use it when making recipes, but I still want to expliciltly verify that I have each of these items when making a plan.
-delete confirmation modal should be something we design not the browser confirm thing.
-there's a weird 0 after "10 min prep" on the salad recipe
-I don't want to ever create a new recipe myself. they sources should only be from an agent. we can look up recipes, but I mostly want to craft them custom based on a set of requirements and a set of ingredients. just like in the phase0 stuff.
-2 sources for recipes initially: 1. the add by conversation options. have a conversation with an agent and hash it out. 2. as part of a meal plan, probably after you cook it and you save it as a favorite.
-no need for voice input button on shopping list.
-shopping list add should have autocompleet from a list of common supermarket items, as well as from a history of what we have shopped for in the past. we'll want to built a profile on each item with any notes, pictures, as well as metadata like what aisle it's in for what store. we'll start with supporting just a single store here, but I'd also like a taxonomy classification so we can guess at aisles and what might be nearby.
-app seems very mobile centric. go through everythign, use devtools for screenshots, and make it look a whole lot nicer for using on a desktop. 
-meal planner offers to plan me a meal for yesterday for some reason.
-meal planner has lots of little buttons, and a wizard looking button in the bottom right and a enw plan in the top right, but also I can add meals to days? this is all very disjointed and confusing ot me. think through a better UX flow for this. do some research (use the skill) to come up with a better design here. make sure it is thought out, linear, and buttons are discoverable and clearly labeled or indicate what they do.
-let's back burner cooking mode for now. so let's disable that functionality entirely and take it off the roadmap. put it in a parking lot. the only functionality I want here is the PDF output and a prompt to copy/paste to anotehr agent for help while cooking.
-remove the versioning/phase from the settings page.


-add property based testing. maybe we already have this?
-add support for weights vs volumes
-security for supabase studio?
-keep recipes under one hour including prep, or make this configurable
-add a way to favorite recipes, and allow seeding a plan with a favorited recipe or selected from so other sort of list.
-we need to verify everything including all sorts of staples.
-when specifying "1 can", also specify the size of the can
-generate PDFs of recipes and evolve the format.
