# Documentation & Visualization

- All project documentation and planning will be viewed on GitHub, so structure markdown files for optimal rendering there, following GitHub Markdown best practices to enhance readability for remote review (e.g., use clear headings, lists, and code blocks).
- Incorporate lots of diagrams using GitHub-supported formats like Mermaid for flowcharts, architecture diagrams, wireframes, etc., to visualize UX flows, data models, system architecture, and other key concepts (e.g., process flow or DB schema).
- Place Mermaid diagrams in dedicated code blocks (```mermaid ... ```) within planning files to ensure proper rendering on GitHub, improving communication of complex ideas like user journeys or component interactions.
- **Table of Contents (TOC)**: All markdown files must include an up-to-date TOC at the top that links to all the sections below.
- I will be primarily viewing them on github, so they need to be syntax correct for a github environment.
- use mermaid diagrams liberally.
- always commit and push after updating a markdown document.
- write for an expert audience, but one who may not be familiar with the minutae of the codebase or project.
- any file mentions should be a link
- every file should have an up to date TOC at the top with links for every entry
