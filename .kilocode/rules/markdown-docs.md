This file is about markdown documents you write for me.

-I will be primarily viewing them on github, so they need to be syntax correct for a github environment.
-use mermaid diagrams liberally.
-always commit and push after updating a markdown document.
-write for an expert audience, but one who may not be familiar with the minutae of the codebase or project.
-any file mentions should be a link
-every file should have an up to date TOC at the top with links for every entry
