# Progress Log - September 2025

## 2025-09-18
- Overhauled the entire project plan to accelerate time-to-value.
- Created a new [phased development plan](../../plans/project-phases.md) to focus on a rapid MVP.
- Re-organized the [development to-do list](../../plans/development-todo.md) to align with the new phases.
- Structured the planning decisions required for each phase to enable just-in-time decision making.
- Added a new "Phase 0" to the development plan for a markdown-driven MVP.
- Created markdown templates in [`plans/meal-plan-generator/`](../../plans/meal-plan-generator/) to allow for manual meal plan generation and testing of the core LLM value proposition before development.
- Redesigned the Phase 0 workflow to be a conversational, iterative process using a series of markdown templates.
- Created a comprehensive example of the new conversational flow.
