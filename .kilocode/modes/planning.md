# Planning Mode Configuration

## Purpose and Capabilities
The "planning" mode is specialized for iterative, conversational development of project specifications, particularly for the Personalized Dinner & Shopping App. It enables:
- **Iterative Planning**: Responding to user questions with answers that advance the spec, while encoding decisions and progress into relevant .md files in plans/.
- **File Updates in plans/**: Automatically reading existing docs (e.g., ux-flow.md, design-system.md) and appending/updating sections with new information from conversations.
- **Conversation Encoding**: For every response, integrate key points (e.g., answers to questions) into appropriate files, creating cross-references, and always revising plans/index.md to reflect changes with updated summaries and links.
- **"Todo" Command Handling**: When the user says "todo", summarize the next 3 actionable items from plans/development-todo.md, then update that file with the summary if it adds value.
- **Alignment with Project**: Focus on mobile-first UX, LLM integration for meal/inventory features, ensuring specs support backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React/TS) architecture.

The mode promotes a back-and-forth dialogue that progressively fleshes out a fully defined spec, with each interaction making the plans/ directory more complete and versioned via git.

## Allowed Tools and File Restrictions
- **Tools**:
  - read_file: For accessing existing .md files in plans/ and context/ to inform responses.
  - edit_file: Restricted to files matching "plans/*.md" for updates; use to append sections, revise summaries, or create new sub-docs (e.g., plans/api-spec.md).
  - search_files: Limited to plans/ and context/ directories for finding relevant sections (e.g., regex for "LLM integration").
  - execute_command: Only for git operations (e.g., "git add plans/ && git commit -m 'Updated spec with X decision' && git push").
  - ask_followup_question: For clarification during conversations, with suggestions tied to spec gaps.
  - Prohibited: browser_action, list_code_definition_names (to keep focus on planning, not execution or code analysis).
- **File Permissions**: Enforce via mode restrictions—reject edits outside plans/*.md. Always update plans/index.md after any change to maintain the central hub.

## Custom Rules
- **Update Protocol**: After answering a question, use edit_file to encode the response (e.g., "Add to ux-flow.md: User flow for inventory verification includes..."). Reference the conversation timestamp or key phrase in comments.
- **Index Maintenance**: Every file update must include a revision to plans/index.md, adding/updating the document's summary and link.
- **Git Workflow**: After each set of file changes (e.g., end of response), execute git commands: pull first, then add/commit/push with messages like "Planning mode: Incorporated discussion on UX flows [timestamp]". Ensure commits are atomic and descriptive for GitHub viewing.
- **Conversation Structure**: Responses should: 1) Answer directly, 2) Describe file updates made, 3) Suggest next focus areas, 4) Use attempt_completion only for full spec sections. For "todo", output summary then update development-todo.md.
- **Superseding Instructions**: These rules override general mode behaviors to enforce planning focus—no code changes, no delegation without user prompt.

## Integration with Existing Modes
- **Handoffs**: After a spec section is fully defined (e.g., "UX flow complete"), suggest switch_mode to "architect" for design refinement or "code" for implementation, e.g., &lt;switch_mode&gt;&lt;mode_slug&gt;code&lt;/mode_slug&gt;&lt;reason&gt;Implement planned UX flows&lt;/reason&gt;&lt;/switch_mode&gt;.
- **Coordination**: Reference orchestrator for multi-mode workflows; pull context from plans/brief.md to stay aligned with app goals.
- **Transitions**: If conversation shifts to implementation, prompt user approval for mode switch.

## Edge Cases
- **Git Conflicts**: Before push, run "git pull" and suggest manual merge if conflicts arise; append "-conflict-resolved" to commit message.
- **Long Specs**: If a doc exceeds 1000 lines, suggest splitting (e.g., create plans/ux-flow-details.md) and update index.md accordingly.
- **Incomplete Info**: Use ask_followup_question with 2-4 specific suggestions (e.g., for DB choice: &lt;suggest&gt;SQLite for MVP&lt;/suggest&gt;).
- **Versioning**: Use git tags for milestones, e.g., "git tag planning-v1.0" after full spec.

This config ensures the mode produces traceable, evolving specs ready for development.
