# Decision Log: Ingredient Optimization Algorithm

This document details the decision-making process for the ingredient optimization algorithm, a key feature for enhancing user experience by providing intelligent meal suggestions and reducing food waste.

*   **Phase:** 1
*   **Status:** In Progress
*   **Owner:** A.I. Assistant

## 1. Problem Statement

Users need a way to find recipes that make the best use of their current pantry items. The system should be able to suggest substitutions for missing ingredients, prioritizing items the user already has. This aligns with the project brief's goal of creating a "smart" kitchen assistant that minimizes waste and simplifies meal planning.

## 2. Core Requirements

*   **Pantry-First Suggestions:** The algorithm must prioritize using ingredients from the user's digital pantry.
*   **Substitution Logic:** Provide sensible substitutions for ingredients a user doesn't have.
*   **Nutritional Awareness:** (Optional, stretch goal) Factor in nutritional similarity when suggesting substitutions.
*   **Personalization:** The algorithm should align with user-defined dietary preferences.

## 3. Next Steps

*   Flesh out specific algorithm options (e.g., similarity scores, heuristics, embeddings).
*   Add pseudocode examples.
*   Create example input/output scenarios.
