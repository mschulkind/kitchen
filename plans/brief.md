Project Summary: Personalized Dinner & Shopping App
This document outlines a preliminary design for a personal-use app to manage dinner recipes, meal planning, and grocery shopping. The primary goal is to create a highly usable, efficient tool that streamlines the process of cooking, tailored to the user's specific tastes, pantry inventory, and gardening habits.

Key Features & User Experience
Intelligent Meal Planning: The app will generate a coherent meal plan for a set number of days (e.g., 4 days) by selecting recipes that are efficient from an ingredient standpoint. The app will prioritize recipes that share ingredients, use up garden surpluses, and incorporate leftovers (e.g., roast chicken one night, chicken soup the next).

Dynamic Inventory Tracking: An internal data model will track pantry staples and fresh garden produce. The recipe selection algorithm will heavily favor recipes that use ingredients the user already has on hand, giving extra weight to common staples like milk and butter.

Intuitive Verification Interface: A core user experience will be the ingredient verification process. A "Categorical Checklist" UI will be implemented, grouping ingredients by their physical location in the kitchen (Pantry, Fridge, Freezer, Garden). This makes it easy for the user to confirm what they already have on hand.

Optimized Shopping List: After verification, the app will generate a final, definitive shopping list. This list will be sorted by average grocery store layout (e.g., Produce, Dairy, Meat) to optimize the in-store shopping trip. The final list will only show items the user needs to purchase.

Technical Architecture
Backend: The backend will be responsible for the core logic, including recipe selection, inventory management, and shopping list generation. It will include a PantryItem data model and a ShoppingListItem data model.

LLM Integration: An LLM agent will be integrated into the backend to provide dynamic capabilities, such as suggesting new recipes based on current ingredients, offering recipe variety, and customizing recipes on the fly.

This preliminary design document captures the core vision for the app, emphasizing usability and efficiency as the primary design drivers.

## Scope and Target Audience
This application is designed for private use by a maximum of two users (a couple). It will be developed exclusively for the Android platform and distributed via side-loading an APK file. There are no plans for a public release on the Google Play Store or for an iOS version. This narrow focus allows for a simplified architecture and a faster development cycle.

## Development Strategy: Simplified Direct-to-Native Approach

Given the private, Android-only nature of the app, we will adopt a streamlined, direct-to-native development strategy. This eliminates the need for a phased rollout or a preliminary web application.

1.  **Backend First:** The initial focus remains on building a robust, "headless" backend using Supabase. This includes the database schema, core business logic, two-user authentication, and LLM integration.
2.  **Direct React Native Development:** We will proceed directly to building the Android application using React Native. The focus will be on creating a functional, user-friendly interface that meets the core requirements without the overhead of multi-platform support or App Store compliance.
3.  **Deployment:** The application will be deployed by generating an APK file that can be side-loaded directly onto the target Android devices.

This simplified strategy significantly reduces complexity and development time, allowing for a rapid path to a usable product for the intended users.
