This index organizes the `docs/` directory, which contains human-readable documentation such as research notes, data dumps, API references, and other supporting materials referenced during development. It helps maintain navigability without cluttering the main planning docs.

## Overview
The `docs/` directory contains documentation that is intended to be read by humans. This includes research notes, references, and other supporting materials that are part of the project documentation but don't fit into the planning specifications.

## Categories and Content

### Research Notes
- **Placeholder**: Add files like `recipe-algorithms-research.md` for explorations on ingredient optimization or meal planning heuristics.
- **Placeholder**: `llm-integration-notes.md` for prompt engineering experiments or API usage insights.

### API References
- **Placeholder**: `openai-api-ref.md` or similar for LLM provider docs, examples, and rate limits.
- **Placeholder**: `grocery-api-exploration.md` if external services (e.g., for store layouts) are researched.

### Data Dumps
- **Placeholder**: `sample-recipes.json` for test datasets of recipes and ingredients.
- **Placeholder**: `pantry-inventory-samples.csv` for example inventory data.

### Temporary Notes
- **Placeholder**: Quick files like `ux-sketch-ideas.txt` for brainstorming sessions.
- **Placeholder**: Debug outputs or temp calculations (e.g., `ingredient-overlap-analysis.py` outputs).

## Navigation Notes
- All files in the `docs/` directory are version-controlled and part of the project documentation.
- Link back to [plans/index.md](../plans/index.md) for core planning docs.
- When adding new content, update this index with a brief description and relative link (e.g., [file-name.ext](file-name.ext)).
- The `context/` directory is gitignored and should only contain files for LLM agent use.

TODO: Populate as research and temp content is added during development.
