This index organizes the `docs/` directory, which contains human-readable documentation such as research notes, data dumps, API references, and other supporting materials referenced during development. It helps maintain navigability without cluttering the main planning docs.

## Overview

This directory contains research, notes, and other supporting documentation for the project.

- **[db-research.md](db-research.md)**: A detailed comparison of database technologies.
- **[phase0-workflow.md](phase0-workflow.md)**: A guide for agents on how to execute the Phase 0 conversational meal planning flow.

## Categories and Content

### Research Notes

- **Placeholder**: Add files like `recipe-algorithms-research.md` for explorations on ingredient optimization or meal planning heuristics.
- **Placeholder**: `llm-integration-notes.md` for prompt engineering experiments or API usage insights.

### API References

- **Placeholder**: `openai-api-ref.md` or similar for LLM provider docs, examples, and rate limits.
- **Placeholder**: `grocery-api-exploration.md` if external services (e.g., for store layouts) are researched.

### Data Dumps

- **Placeholder**: `sample-recipes.json` for test datasets of recipes and ingredients.
- **Placeholder**: `pantry-inventory-samples.csv` for example inventory data.

### Temporary Notes

- **Placeholder**: Quick files like `ux-sketch-ideas.txt` for brainstorming sessions.
- **Placeholder**: Debug outputs or temp calculations (e.g., `ingredient-overlap-analysis.py` outputs).

## Navigation Notes

- All files in the `docs/` directory are version-controlled and part of the project documentation.
- Link back to [plans/index.md](../plans/index.md) for core planning docs.
- When adding new content, update this index with a brief description and relative link (e.g., [file-name.ext](file-name.ext)).
- The `context/` directory is gitignored and should only contain files for LLM agent use.

TODO: Populate as research and temp content is added during development.
