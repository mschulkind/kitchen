# 05 — AI Recipe Chat 🤖🍳

> Create recipes through conversation with an AI. Describe what you want, what you have, and let the AI propose, refine, and save recipes for you.

---

## Overview

This is the primary way users create new recipes in the Kitchen app. Instead of filling out forms, users have a natural conversation with an AI assistant. They describe constraints ("I have chicken thighs and broccoli, make something quick"), preferences ("my kids don't like spicy"), and context ("we're having guests"). The AI proposes recipes, the user refines them, and the final version is saved to their collection.

This is the most complex feature in the app and the core differentiator.

**Fun fact:** 🐋 If whales had AI recipe chat, every conversation would end with "How about krill? Again? Fine, krill it is." We aim for more variety. 🍽️

## User Stories

### US-CHAT-01: Start a Recipe Conversation
**As a** user who wants a new recipe,
**I want to** open a chat and describe what I'm looking for,
**So that** an AI can help me craft the perfect dish.

### US-CHAT-02: Use Pantry Context
**As a** user who wants to cook with what I have,
**I want to** the AI to know what's in my pantry,
**So that** it suggests recipes using available ingredients.

### US-CHAT-03: Specify Constraints
**As a** user with dietary needs or preferences,
**I want to** tell the AI about restrictions (vegetarian, kid-friendly, under 30 min, no mushrooms),
**So that** recipes fit my actual needs.

### US-CHAT-04: Refine Proposals
**As a** user reviewing an AI proposal,
**I want to** say "swap the broccoli for green beans" or "make it spicier,"
**So that** the recipe evolves to match what I actually want.

### US-CHAT-05: Save Recipe to Collection
**As a** user who likes a proposed recipe,
**I want to** save it to my recipe collection with one tap,
**So that** I can cook it later or add it to a meal plan.

### US-CHAT-06: Generate Multiple Options
**As a** user who wants choices,
**I want to** the AI to propose 2-3 options,
**So that** I can pick the one that sounds best.

### US-CHAT-07: Use Conversation History
**As a** user returning to a chat,
**I want to** see our previous conversation,
**So that** I can continue refining or start from where I left off.

### US-CHAT-08: Recipe from Leftovers
**As a** user with leftover ingredients from a previous meal,
**I want to** tell the AI what I have left over,
**So that** it suggests creative ways to use them up.

## Technical Architecture

### LLM Integration
- **Development:** Ollama (local, self-hosted)
- **Production:** Multi-provider adapter (Gemini, Claude, OpenAI — per D6)
- **Backend endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/recipes/chat`
- **Streaming:** SSE or WebSocket for real-time token streaming
- **Context window:** System prompt + pantry snapshot + conversation history + user preferences

### System Prompt Design
The AI should:
1. Know the user's pantry contents (injected as context)
2. Know dietary preferences and dislikes (from user profile/settings)
3. Know household composition (adults, kids)
4. Respond with structured recipe data (not just text)
5. Calculate pantry match percentage
6. Suggest substitutions for missing ingredients
7. Support iterative refinement

### API Flow

## Business Rules

1. **No recipe creation without AI** — the only path to new recipes is chat or URL import
2. **Pantry context is automatic** — AI always has access to current pantry state
3. **Recipes must be structured** — AI output is parsed into proper ingredient/instruction format before saving
4. **Conversation history preserved** — users can return to old chats
5. **Multiple proposals per turn** — AI should offer 2-3 options when proposing recipes
6. **Pantry match scoring** — each proposal shows what % of ingredients user already has
7. **Saved recipes are first-class** — once saved, they're identical to URL-imported recipes
8. **Preference learning** — over time, AI should learn user preferences (likes, dislikes, past favorites)

## Open Questions

### OQ-CHAT-01: Ollama Model Selection
Which Ollama model should we use? Llama 3? Mistral? How much context window do we need for pantry + history?

### OQ-CHAT-02: Streaming vs. Batch
Should responses stream token-by-token (better UX) or return as complete messages (simpler)?

### OQ-CHAT-03: Structured Output Format
How do we ensure the LLM returns properly structured recipe data? JSON mode? Function calling? Post-processing?

### OQ-CHAT-04: Conversation Length
How many messages before we truncate history? Should old context be summarized?

### OQ-CHAT-05: Multi-Recipe Conversations
Can a single chat session produce multiple recipes? (e.g., "give me a main and a side")

### OQ-CHAT-06: Preference Persistence
Should user preferences (likes, dislikes) be stored in a profile table or inferred from conversation history?

### OQ-CHAT-07: Offline Behavior
What happens if the LLM is unavailable? Show error? Suggest URL import instead?

### OQ-CHAT-08: Cost / Rate Limiting
For cloud LLMs (production), how do we manage costs? Per-household rate limits?
