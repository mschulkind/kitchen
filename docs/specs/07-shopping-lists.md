# 07 — Shopping Lists 🛒

> Shared shopping lists with smart categorization, autocomplete, item profiles, and store-aware aisle sorting.

---

## Overview

The Shopping List is where meal planning meets the real world. Users add items manually, or the planner auto-generates them from recipes. Items are automatically categorized (Produce, Dairy, Meat, etc.) and can be checked off as you shop. The list is realtime — multiple household members can check off items simultaneously.

The big vision: each item builds a **profile** over time — brand preferences, notes, aisle numbers, pictures. Autocomplete draws from a USDA-based taxonomy and past purchase history. Categories are smart enough to predict which aisle an item is in.

**Fun fact:** 🐋 A whale shark filters 6,000 liters of water per hour looking for food. Our shopping list autocomplete is basically the same concept but for groceries. 🦈

## Business Rules

1. **Auto-categorization:** When adding an item, category is guessed from name keywords
2. **Deduplication:** Shopping list generation skips items already on the list
3. **Pantry-aware:** Generation skips items user already has in pantry
4. **Optimistic updates:** Checking/unchecking items updates UI immediately, syncs in background
5. **Realtime sync:** All changes broadcast via Supabase realtime channels
6. **Item aggregation:** If multiple recipes need "onion", combine into one item with total quantity
7. **Global profiles are read-only:** Users can't modify seed data, only add household overrides
8. **Purchase history auto-tracks:** When items are checked off, record in history
9. **Autocomplete prioritizes recency:** Recent purchases appear first, then taxonomy matches

## Open Questions

### OQ-SHOP-01: USDA Data Curation
How do we filter the USDA database to ~2-5K consumer-friendly items? Manual curation? LLM-assisted?

### OQ-SHOP-02: Aisle Accuracy
Aisle numbers vary wildly by store. Should we start with generic category-based ordering and let users customize per store later?

### OQ-SHOP-03: Item Matching
How do we match "milk" (shopping list) to "Milk, whole" (USDA)? Fuzzy matching? Alias table?

### OQ-SHOP-04: Photo Capture
Should item profiles support photos? (e.g., "This is the exact brand I want") If so, where stored?

### OQ-SHOP-05: Multi-Store Support
The user mentioned starting with one store. When do we add multi-store? What changes in the data model?

### OQ-SHOP-06: Recipe Source Annotation
When items come from meal plan generation, should the list show which recipe they're for? (e.g., "Chicken thighs — for Honey Garlic Chicken")
