## Instructions
1.  **Make the tacos**: Heat the oven to 425Â°F. Put the sweet potatoes and poblanos on a rimmed sheet pan. Drizzle with the oil and sprinkle with the salt. Toss to coat and spread in a single layer. Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, until tender.
2.  **Make the salsa**: In a medium bowl, stir together the corn, onion, cilantro, oil, lime juice, chipotle powder, and salt.
3.  To heat the tortillas, turn the flame on your stove to medium-high. Using tongs, grab a tortilla and drag it over the burner grate, flipping it, until lightly charred on both sides but still pliable. (Alternatively, heat the tortillas in a dry medium skillet over medium-high heat.)
4.  Fill the tortillas with the sweet potato mixture, corn salsa, and a slice of avocado. Serve the tacos with hot sauce and a couple wedges of lime.
