# Bean & Cheese Tostada

Easy weekday tostada recipe that's good for breakfast or lunch.

### Ingredients

#### Refried Beans
* 400g pinto beans (1 14 oz can)
* Cooking oil, a drizzle
* 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* Cumin seeds, a sprinkle
* Smoked paprika, a sprinkle
* Salt, to taste
* Lime juice, to taste

#### Tostada Components
* 2-4 tostadas
* Monterey jack cheese, shredded
* Sour cream

#### Breakfast Additions
* Eggs, fried
* Hot sauce
* Cilantro

#### Lunch Additions
* Lettuce, shredded
* Tomatoes, diced
* Pickled onions

### Instructions

1. **Simmer the beans**: Set a pan over medium-high heat and add a drizzle of oil to the pan. Add the sliced garlic and cumin seeds to the pan. Let these bloom for 60 seconds to flavor the oil. Then, right before adding the beans, add a sprinkle of smoked paprika. Follow this by adding the pinto beans, including the liquid. Bring this mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 5 minutes.

2. **Mash the beans**: Using a potato masher or fork, mash the beans until they are mostly broken down, but you can make this smoother or chunkier depending on your preference. If you want it thicker, let it simmer for an additional couple of minutes so more moisture evaporates. Once you've reached your desired texture, shut off the heat and taste. Adjust with salt and a squeeze of lime juice as needed.

3. **Assemble & serve**: Gather the tostadas and any toppings you want. If making the breakfast version, fry up an egg per tostada at this time. To a tostada, add your cheese first and follow that with the hot beans over the top so it starts to soften and melt a little bit. Once the beans are added, add a drizzle of crema or sour cream. For the breakfast version, lay the fried egg on top, and finish with any other toppings. For the lunch version, top with shredded lettuce, red onion, diced tomatoes, or your toppings of choice. Enjoy.
