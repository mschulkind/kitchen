# Tinga Poblana Tostada

Flavorful tostada dish for when you've got some braised meat on hand.

### Ingredients

#### Tinga Poblana Sauce
* 800g whole peeled tomatoes (1 28 oz can)
* 2-3 chipotles in adobo
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1/4 onion
* 1 bay leaf
* Dried oregano, a sprinkle
* Sugar, to taste
* Salt, to taste
* Cooking oil, a drizzle

#### Tostada Toppings (to preference)
* Braised meat
* Tostadas
* Avocados
* Onions, diced
* Sour cream
* Cotija cheese
* Limes

### Instructions

1. **Blend the sauce**: Add all tinga poblana sauce ingredients except for the oil and bay leaf to a blender. Puree until smooth.

2. **Simmer the sauce**: Over medium-high heat, add a layer of oil and the bay leaf to a pan. Let that sizzle for 20 seconds before pouring in the sauce. Simmer for 5 minutes or until slightly thickened.

3. **Toss in meat**: Toss in whatever braised/shredded meat you are using from the fridge. Mix that up until incorporated. You want the flavor to develop, so turn the heat down to a simmer and stir frequently. Reduce until thickened, about 10 more minutes.

4. **Assemble the tostada**: To assemble, add a layer of your tinga meat followed by toppings of choice. Enjoy!
