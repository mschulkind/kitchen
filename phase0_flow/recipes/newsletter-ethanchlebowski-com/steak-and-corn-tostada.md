# Steak & Corn Tostada

Creamy, sweet and a little smoky.

## Ingredients

### Steak

- 900g flank, skirt, or flatiron steak
- Salt, a sprinkle
- Cooking oil, for searing

### Chili Lime Corn

- 2 corn ears
- Lime juice, from 1 lime
- Cilantro, chopped stems, a handful
- Smoked paprika, a spoonful
- Salt, to taste

### Tostada Components

- 4-6 tostadas
- Crema
- Salsa verde
- Pickled onions
- Queso fresco

## Instructions

1. **Dry brine the steak**: Pat the steak dry and cover all sides with a sprinkle of salt. Optional: Rest on a wire rack or paper towel in the fridge until ready to cook, preferably for a few hours or even overnight. This dry brining process will help it sear, retain more moisture during cooking, and be evenly seasoned.

2. **Char the corn**: Take each ear of corn and remove the kernels by slicing them off the length of the cob. Set a pan or griddle over high heat, and toss the corn onto it with a bit of cooking oil. Cook until the kernels develop some charring or black spots on most pieces. Remove from the pan into a mixing bowl.

3. **Make the corn salsa**: Clean a handful of cilantro, making sure to wash out any dirt from the stem ends. Slice the stems into small pieces, so they match the size of the corn kernels. Add to the bowl with the corn. Add the smoked paprika to the corn and stir everything together. Lastly, add the juice from 1/2 of a lime to start and a generous sprinkle of salt. Taste and adjust with more lime, salt, or spices as needed. Set aside.

4. **Sear the steak & serve**: Add a little drizzle of oil to a ripping hot griddle, pan, or grill. Add the steak and cook, flipping occasionally, until well seared and charred on both sides, and the interior has reached at least 120°F/49°C (medium rare). Pull off the heat and let it rest. Meanwhile, gather the rest of the tostada components. Slice the rested steak into thin slices, across the grain.

5. **Assemble**: Add a layer of crema or sour cream and follow that with a few spoonfuls of corn salsa. Make sure you get some even spread to the outskirts of the tostada. Then add a layer of the sliced steak and finish with any other toppings, to preference. Enjoy.
