# Meal Plan Request

- **Start Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Days**: 5
- **Adults**: 4

## Notes

- For one of the meals I want it to be ethan's bean and cheese tostadas, but I don't want it to the first in the sequence.
- I want prior meals to leave some leftovers that can be used for a version of this tostada.
- The meal that provides leftovers *must* be the **Braised Pork Shoulder Skillet**.
- The plan should revolve around a **multi-use subrecipe** (like homemade refried beans or a sauce) that is made in a large batch on one day and used in several meals throughout the plan.
