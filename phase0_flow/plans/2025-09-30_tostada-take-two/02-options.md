# Meal Plan Options: The Flavor Base Challenge! 🧑‍🍳

New plan! We're building these options around two core ideas: a delicious **Braised Pork Shoulder Skillet** that makes leftovers, and a versatile **Flavor Base** to tie the meals together. Let's get cooking! 🥳

### Option 1: The Sofrito Fiesta 💃

*   **Flavor Base**: A classic **Sofrito** (onions, bell peppers, garlic, and tomatoes) that can be used in many Latin-inspired dishes.
*   **Meals**:
    1.  **Sofrito & Pork Skillet** 🍳: We'll make the sofrito and use some of it to cook the braised pork shoulder with potatoes. This makes our leftovers!
    2.  **Sofrito Chicken & Rice** 🍚: The rest of the sofrito becomes a savory base for a one-pan meal with your cooked chicken and rice.
    3.  **Ethan's Tostadas with Crispy Pork** 🌮: The classic bean and cheese tostadas, topped with the crispy leftover pork.
    4.  **Black Bean Soup** 🥣: We can use a touch of the sofrito to deepen the flavor of a simple black bean soup from your pantry staples.
*   **Key New Ingredients**: Bell peppers, canned tomatoes, black beans.

### Option 2: The Savory Herb & Garlic Butter Base 🌿

*   **Flavor Base**: A compound **Herb & Garlic Butter** (butter, minced garlic, fresh or dried herbs like rosemary and thyme).
*   **Meals**:
    1.  **Garlic-Herb Pork Skillet** 🍳: We'll crisp up the pork shoulder and potatoes in our delicious garlic-herb butter. Leftovers are guaranteed!
    2.  **Garlic-Herb Pollock** 🐟: Your pollock filets, pan-seared to perfection with a healthy dollop of the flavor base. Served with carrots.
    3.  **Ethan's Tostadas with Crispy Pork** 🌮: The bean and cheese tostadas, made even better with the garlic-herb crispy pork.
    4.  **Garlic Bread Pasta** 🍝: A simple pasta dish tossed with the remaining garlic-herb butter and a side of your sourdough bread, toasted.
*   **Key New Ingredients**: Fresh or dried herbs (rosemary/thyme if you don't have them).

### Option 3: The Tangy Vinaigrette Adventure 🥗

*   **Flavor Base**: A zesty homemade **Balsamic Vinaigrette** (balsamic, olive oil, garlic, maybe a touch of sweetener).
*   **Meals**:
    1.  **Pork & Potato Skillet with Vinaigrette Drizzle** 🍳: The crispy pork and potatoes get a flavor explosion from a drizzle of our tangy vinaigrette after cooking.
    2.  **Marinated Chicken Salad** 🥗: We'll use the vinaigrette to marinate your chicken thighs before grilling or pan-searing, then serve them over a simple green salad.
    3.  **Ethan's Tostadas with Crispy Pork** 🌮: The tang from the pork leftovers will cut through the richness of the cheese and beans beautifully.
    4.  **Caprese-Style Pasta** 🍝: A simple dish of pasta, cherry tomatoes (if available), and mozzarella, all brought together with our versatile vinaigrette.
*   **Key New Ingredients**: Salad greens, cherry tomatoes.

### Option 4: The Smoky Spice Rub Sensation 🔥

*   **Flavor Base**: A homemade **Smoky Spice Rub** (paprika, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder - all from your pantry!).
*   **Meals**:
    1.  **Spiced Pork & Potato Skillet** 🍳: We'll toss the pork and potatoes in our smoky spice rub before crisping them up.
    2.  **Smoky Chicken Wings** 🍗: Your chicken wings, coated in the spice rub and baked or grilled until crispy.
    3.  **Ethan's Tostadas with Smoky Crispy Pork** 🌮: The spice from the leftover pork will make these tostadas unforgettable.
    4.  **Spiced Pollock Tacos** 🐟: We'll use the spice rub on your pollock filets, then flake them into corn tortillas for a quick and easy taco night.
*   **Key New Ingredients**: Corn tortillas (or use your masa harina to make fresh ones!).
