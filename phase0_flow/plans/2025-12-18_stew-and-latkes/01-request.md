# Meal Plan Request: Stew & Latke Party

## Schedule & Portions

- **Thursday, Dec 18 (Tonight):** Dinner for 2 adults + 2 kids (under 8).
- **Friday, Dec 19 (Tomorrow):** Leftovers from Thursday's dinner.
- **Saturday, Dec 20 (Dinner Party):** Dinner for 4 adults + 5 kids (all under 8).
  - Hosts: 2 adults, 2 kids.
  - Guests: 2 adults, 3 kids (Non-Jewish, likely unfamiliar with Jewish food).

## Meal Requirements

### Meal 1: Thursday Night (Rich Stew)

- **Goal:** A rich, flavorful stew with deep developed flavors.
- **Leftovers:** Must generate enough for Friday night dinner as well.
- **Inspiration:** Maghrebi-Style Spiced Tomato & Lentil Bread Stew.
  - *Concept:* Mediterranean/North African "Bread Stew".
  - *Key Elements:* Toasted sourdough cubes, brown/green lentils, spiced tomato base (Cumin, Coriander, Ceylon Cinnamon).
  - *Flavor Balance:* Dalmatia Fig Spread + Lemon Juice (instead of pomegranate molasses).
  - *Topping:* Feta marinated in olive oil, lemon zest, dill.

### Meal 2: Saturday Night (Latke Party)

- **Core Dish:** Latkes (Recipe/Plan already covered).
- **Need:** 1-2 additional dishes to turn "Latkes" into a full dinner.
- **Theme:** Jewish cuisine, accessible to non-Jewish guests.
- **Constraints:** Kid-friendly options needed (or dishes that can be adapted/separated).

## Notes

- Kids are young (under 8), so "rich and flavorful" for adults might need a "deconstructed" or simpler option for them, or just be aware they won't eat much.
- Saturday guests are new to Jewish food, so classic, crowd-pleasing, or "gateway" Jewish dishes are preferred.
