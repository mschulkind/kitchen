## 💡 Recommended Pairings (Maximum Synergy)

If you want to minimize your shopping list and save money, choose one of these "Power Pairs":

### 🏆 The "Dill & Lemon" Bundle (Option 1 + A or D)

- **Why:** Both the **Original Maghrebi Stew** and the **Brisket (A)** or **Salmon (D)** rely heavily on fresh Dill and Lemons.
- **Savings:** Buy one large "bulk" bunch of dill and a 2lb bag of lemons. You'll use them across every single meal.
- **Best for:** Fans of bright, acidic, and herbaceous flavors.

### 🏆 The "Creamy & Fresh" Bundle (Option 3 + D)

- **Why:** The **Green Lentil Stew** uses Yogurt, and the **Salmon Bar (D)** uses Creme Fraiche.
- **Savings:** Buy one large tub of high-quality Greek Yogurt. It works perfectly as the stew swirl AND as the creamy topping for latkes/salmon.
- **Best for:** A lighter, more modern feeling menu.

### 🏆 The "Produce Power" Bundle (Option 5 + B)

- **Why:** The **Harira Stew** and **Schnitzel/Israeli Salad (B)** both require a lot of "crisper drawer" items (Lemons, Celery, Cucumbers, Tomatoes).
- **Savings:** You can buy your produce in one go and use the "scraps" (like celery hearts or extra parsley) across both nights.
- **Best for:** If you want a very fresh, vegetable-forward week.

### 🏆 The "Pantry Hero" Bundle (Option 2 + E)

- **Why:** The **Smoky Red Pepper Stew** and **Sweet & Sour Meatballs** rely mostly on jarred/canned goods (Roasted Peppers, Chickpeas, Cranberry Sauce).
- **Savings:** Lowest "fresh" grocery bill. Most ingredients are shelf-stable or frozen (like the ground beef).
- **Best for:** A busy week where you don't want to worry about produce wilting.
