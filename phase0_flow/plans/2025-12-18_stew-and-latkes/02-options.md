# Meal Plan Options

Here are 4 options for your upcoming meals. All options include the **Maghrebi-Style Stew** for Thursday/Friday. The variation comes in the **Saturday Dinner Party** menu to complement your Latkes.

## Option 1: The Classic Brisket (Crowd Pleaser)
A traditional, melt-in-your-mouth brisket is the ultimate partner for latkes. It's rich, savory, and the sauce is perfect for dipping latkes into.

*   **Saturday Menu:**
    *   **Main:** Slow-Cooked Beef Brisket with Onions & Carrots (Sweet & Savory).
    *   **Side:** Your Latkes.
    *   **Side:** Cucumber & Dill Salad (Acidic and crisp to cut through the richness).
    *   **Starter:** Matzo Ball Soup (Kids usually love the "fluffy balls").

**Key New Ingredients:**
*   **Produce:** Fresh Dill, Lemons, Cucumbers, Carrots, Onions, Parsnips (for soup).
