# Cucumber & Dill Salad

*A simple, crisp side dish to cut through the richness of the brisket and latkes.*

**Ingredients:**

- 2 English Cucumbers (or 4-5 Persian), thinly sliced rounds
- 1/2 Red Onion, very thinly sliced half-moons
- 1/4 cup Vinegar (Apple Cider or Red Wine)
- 1 tbsp Sugar
- 1 tsp Salt
- 1/2 tsp Black Pepper
- 1 large bunch Fresh Dill, chopped (don't be shy!)

**Instructions:**

1. **The Dressing:** In a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper until the sugar and salt are mostly dissolved.
2. **The Toss:** Add the sliced cucumbers, red onion, and chopped dill. Toss well to coat everything.
3. **The Marinate:** Let the salad sit in the fridge for at least **30 minutes** (up to 2 hours) before serving. This draws some water out of the cucumbers and mellows the onion bite.
4. **Serve:** Give it one last toss before serving. Use a slotted spoon if too much liquid has accumulated.
