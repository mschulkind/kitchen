Here are 5 different ways to view the execution of this recipe. Choose the one that fits your cooking style best.

---

### Format 1: The "Mise-en-place" & Execution Flow
*Best for: Ensuring you have everything ready before you start the heat.*

**Mise-en-place:**
*   **The Meat:** 4-5 lb Beef Brisket (pat dry, heavily salted & peppered).
*   **Aromatics:** 3-4 large Onions (thick slices), 1 bag Carrots (peeled, chunks), 4 cloves Garlic (smashed).
*   **The Braise Liquid:** 2 cups Beef Broth, 1/2 cup Ketchup, 2 tbsp Fig Spread.
*   **Herbs:** Fresh Thyme bunch, 2 Bay Leaves.

**Execution:**
1.  **Sear:** Heat oil in large Dutch oven. Sear brisket hard on both sides until dark brown (5-8m per side). Remove meat.
2.  **Deglaze/Sauté:** Add onions to the beef fat. Cook until browning edges (5m).
3.  **Build Sauce:** Stir in broth, ketchup, and fig spread. Scrape up browned bits (fond).
4.  **Assemble:** Return brisket to pot (fat cap up). Surround with carrots, garlic, and herbs.
5.  **Braise:** Cover tightly. Bake at $300^\circ\text{F}$ for 4-5 hours.
6.  **Rest:** Remove from oven. Let rest in liquid for 30m.
7.  **Serve:** Slice against the grain. Serve with the soft veggies and pan sauce.

### Format 2: The "Flavor Layers" (Step-by-Step Build)
*Best for: Understanding the sequential build-up of flavors.*

1.  **MAILLARD Layer:** Searing the raw brisket creates the first layer of deep, roasted meat flavor. Don't skip this; the brown crust is essential.
2.  **SWEET ONION Layer:** Cooking the onions in the rendered beef fat picks up that flavor and starts caramelizing the onions, providing a savory-sweet base.
3.  **UMAMI-GLAZE Layer:** The mixture of beef broth, ketchup (acid/sugar/tomato), and fig spread (earthy sweetness) creates a complex braising liquid that reduces into a rich gravy over time.
4.  **SLOW INFUSION Layer:** Over 4-5 hours, the collagen in the brisket breaks down into gelatin, thickening the sauce, while the thyme and bay leaf infuse everything with herbal notes.

### Format 4: The "Timeline" (Parallel Processor)
*Best for: Optimization and multi-tasking.*

| Time | Action | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T-5:30** | **Oven 300F** | Season meat. Slice onions/carrots. |
| **T-5:15** | **Sear** | Brown meat on stove. |
| **T-5:00** | **Build** | Sauté onions, add liquid, return meat. |
| **T-4:50** | **Braise** | Lid on. Into the oven. |
| **...** | *Relax* | *Go do something else for 4 hours.* |
| **T-0:30** | **Check** | Fork tender? If yes, pull out. |
| **T-0:00** | **Serve** | Slice and plate after resting. |

### Format 5: The "Sensory Script" (Audio-Visual)
*Best for: Cooking by feel and intuition.*

*   **LISTEN:** When searing, you want a loud, aggressive sizzle. If it goes quiet, turn up the heat.
*   **LOOK:** The brisket should be a deep mahogany brown after searing, not just grey-ish.
*   **SMELL:** After 3 hours, the house should smell intensely savory and sweet.
*   **TOUCH:** When checking doneness, a fork should slide into the thickest part of the meat with zero resistance (like butter). If it "grabs" the fork, it needs more time.
*   **LOOK:** The sauce should be dark and glossy, not watery.
