Here are 5 different ways to view the execution of this recipe. Choose the one that fits your cooking style best.

### Format 1: The "Mise-en-place" & Execution Flow
*Best for: Ensuring you have everything ready before you start the heat.*

**Mise-en-place:**

*   **The Bread:** 1/2 Sourdough Loaf (cubed into 1-inch pieces).
*   **Aromatics:** 1 large Onion (diced), 3 cloves Garlic (minced).
*   **Flavor Base:** 2 tbsp Tomato Paste, 2 tbsp Fig Spread.
*   **Spices:** 1 tsp Cumin, 1 tsp Coriander, 1/2 tsp Cinnamon.
*   **Liquids:** 1 can (28oz) Crushed Tomatoes, 4 cups Water (or Broth).
*   **The Bulk:** 1 cup Brown/Green Lentils (rinsed).
*   **The Finish:** 1 large bag Spinach or Chard, 1 Lemon (juiced), Sour Cream, Fresh Dill.

**Execution:**

1.  **Toast:** Bake bread cubes at $400^\circ\text{F}$ until bone dry and golden (15-20m).
2.  **Sweat:** Sauté onion in olive oil until soft (5-8m). Add garlic for 1m.
3.  **Deepen:** Add tomato paste & spices. Fry until paste darkens (2-3m).
4.  **Simmer:** Add lentils, water/broth, crushed tomatoes, and fig spread. **NO SALT YET.** Simmer covered until lentils are tender (25-30m).
5.  **Finish:** Stir in salt, lemon juice, and greens until wilted.
6.  **Stew:** Turn off heat. Fold in toasted bread. Let sit 10m.
7.  **Serve:** Top with sour cream and fresh dill.

### Format 2: The "Flavor Layers" (Step-by-Step Build)
*Best for: Understanding the sequential build-up of flavors.*

1.  **TEXTURE Layer:** Roast the sourdough cubes in the oven first. We want them super dry so they soak up the stew without disintegrating into mush.
2.  **AROMATIC Layer:** Sauté onions and garlic. This provides the sweet, savory backbone.
3.  **SPICE Layer:** Fry the tomato paste with cumin, coriander, and cinnamon. This "blooms" the spices and caramelizes the sugars in the paste for depth.
4.  **EARTH Layer:** Simmer the lentils with the crushed tomatoes and fig spread. The fig adds a hidden sweetness that mimics North African tagines. *Crucial:* No salt or acid yet, or the lentils won't soften properly.
5.  **FRESH Layer:** Once lentils are soft, hit it with salt, lemon juice (acid), and the fresh greens.
6.  **UNION Layer:** Fold the dry bread into the wet stew off the heat. The bread drinks up the liquid, thickening the stew and becoming dumpling-like.

### Format 5: The "Sensory Script" (Audio-Visual)
*Best for: Cooking by feel and intuition.*

*   **TOUCH:** Bread should feel rock hard and dry coming out of the oven.
*   **SMELL:** When frying the paste/spices, wait for the "toasted spice" smell to fill the kitchen (approx 2 mins).
*   **LOOK:** The tomato paste should turn from bright red to a rusty brick color.
*   **TASTE:** Taste the lentils before adding salt. They should be creamy inside, not chalky.
*   **TASTE:** After adding lemon and fig spread, the broth should be a balance of savory, deep sweet, and bright acid.
*   **LOOK:** When you fold in the bread, it will look like too much bread. Wait 10 mins, and it will look like a thick, cohesive stew.
