# Ingredient Verification: Green Stew & Brisket Party (Updated)

I've updated the list to remove the Matzo Ball Soup ingredients and added a few key items we missed (like the Fig Spread for that deep flavor!).

## 🛒 Shopping List (Items you likely need)

### Produce
- [ ] **Fresh Dill** (1 large bunch; for stew swirl and salad)
- [ ] **Spinach or Swiss Chard** (1 large bag/bunch for Thursday's stew)

- [ ] **Carrots** (1 bag; for Brisket)
- [ ] **Cucumbers** (2 English or 4-5 Persian for the Saturday salad)

### Pantry / Bakery
- [ ] **Sourdough Loaf** (1 large, dense/rustic loaf for Thursday's stew)
- [ ] **Brown or Green Lentils** (1 bag/box)
