## 🍳 Recipes

### 1. "Green" Maghrebi Lentil & Bread Stew (Thursday)
*Inspired by the Maghrebi Bread Stew, but lightened with greens and sour cream.*

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup Brown/Green Lentils
- 1/2 Sourdough Loaf (cubed and toasted until dry)
- 1 Onion, diced
- 3 cloves Garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp Tomato Paste
- 1 tsp Cumin, 1 tsp Coriander, 1/2 tsp Cinnamon
- 1 large bag Spinach or Chard
- 1 Lemon (juiced)
- **Topping:** Sour Cream mixed with fresh Dill and Lemon zest.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Toast Bread:** Cube sourdough and bake at $400^\circ\text{F}$ until very dry and golden.
2.  **Sauté:** Cook onion and garlic in olive oil until soft. Stir in tomato paste and spices until fragrant.
3.  **Simmer Lentils:** Add lentils and 4 cups water (or broth). **Do not salt yet.** Simmer for 25 mins until lentils are $75\%$ tender.
4.  **Finish Base:** Add salt, lemon juice, and the greens. Stir until greens are wilted.
5.  **The "Stewing":** Turn off heat. Fold in the toasted bread cubes. Let sit for 10 minutes to absorb the liquid.
6.  **Serve:** Top with a dollop of the dill-sour cream and extra fresh dill.

### 2. Slow-Cooked Beef Brisket (Saturday)
*A classic, foolproof brisket that makes its own incredible gravy.*

**Ingredients:**
- 4-5 lb Beef Brisket
- 3-4 large Onions, sliced into thick rings
- 1 bag Carrots, peeled and cut into chunks
- 2 cups Beef Broth (from freezer)
- 1/2 cup Ketchup (from fridge)
- 2 tbsp Brown Sugar (or a bit of that Fig Spread!)

2.  **Aromatics:** Sauté onions in the same pot until they start to brown.
3.  **Liquid:** Stir in broth, ketchup, and sugar/fig spread.
4.  **Slow Cook:** Place brisket back in, fat side up. Add carrots, thyme, and bay leaves.
5.  **Oven:** Cover tightly and bake at $300^\circ\text{F}$ for 4-5 hours until fork-tender.
6.  **Rest & Slice:** Let the meat rest for at least 30 mins before slicing against the grain. Serve with the onions, carrots, and plenty of sauce.

### 3. Cucumber & Dill Salad (Saturday)

**Ingredients:**
- Cucumbers, thinly sliced
- 1/2 Red Onion (optional), thinly sliced

- Lots of fresh Dill, chopped
