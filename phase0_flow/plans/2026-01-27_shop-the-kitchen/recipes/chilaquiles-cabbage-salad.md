## Ingredients

### The Base (50% Veggie)
- 1/2 head Green Cabbage, very thinly shredded
- 4-5 Radishes, thinly sliced
- Juice of 2 Limes
- Pinch of salt (careful, chicken is salty)

### The Protein (25% Protein)
- 12-16 oz Rastelli’s Street Taco Chicken Strips (Raw)
- 1 tbsp Olive oil

### The Sauce & Extra Veg (The Bulk)
- 1 cup Frozen Spinach
- 1 can (14.5 oz) Diced or Crushed Tomatoes
- 1/2 Yellow Onion, diced
- 1 tsp Minced Garlic
- 1 tsp Chili Powder
- 1/2 tsp Cumin
- Optional: Splash of water or broth if too thick

### The "Rustic" Masa Strips (25% Starch)
- 1 cup Masa Harina
- ~2/3 cup Warm Water
- Pinch of salt

### Garnishes
- Greek Yogurt (as a crema)
- Shredded Cheese (Cheddar or Mozzarella)

## Instructions

### 1. The Masa Strips (Starch)
1. Mix **Masa Harina**, water, and salt until a dough forms.
2. Flatten into 2-3 large discs between parchment paper (or plastic wrap) using a heavy pot or rolling pin.
3. Slice into 1-inch wide strips.
4. Heat a dry skillet over medium-high. Char the strips for 2 mins per side until firm and spotted. Set aside.

### 2. The Chicken (Protein)
1. In the same skillet, add **Olive Oil**.
2. Sear the **Taco Chicken Strips** until fully cooked and slightly browned (approx 6-8 mins). Set aside.

### 3. The Sauce (Veggie Bulk)
1. Sauté **Onion** and **Garlic** in the skillet until soft.
2. Add **Canned Tomatoes**, **Chili Powder**, and **Cumin**. Simmer for 5 mins.
3. Stir in the **Frozen Spinach**. Cook until wilted and the sauce is thick.

### 4. The Base (Veggie Volume)
1. In a large bowl, toss the shredded **Cabbage** and **Radishes** with **Lime Juice**.
2. Spread a massive layer of this on each plate (it should be half the plate's volume).

### 5. Assembly
1. Gently toss the cooked **Chicken** and **Masa Strips** into the warm tomato/spinach sauce to coat.
2. Ladle the saucy mixture directly over the cabbage beds.
3. Top with a dollop of **Greek Yogurt** and a sprinkle of **Cheese**.

## Flavor Layer
The raw lime-cabbage provides a bright, acidic crunch that cuts through the warm, earthy masa and spicy tomato sauce.

## Kid Submeal
Serve the Masa Strips and Chicken "deconstructed" alongside a smaller pile of cabbage (or just the radishes if they prefer the crunch).
