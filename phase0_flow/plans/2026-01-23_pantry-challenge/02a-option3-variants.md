## Variant A: "Sesame Ginger Crunch" (The Classic Stir-Fry)
**The Vibe:** Salty, nutty, and traditional stir-fry flavors.
**The Twist:** Leans heavily on the **Ginger** and **Onion** aromatics. We use the **Corn** and **Cabbage** as the primary crunch.
**The Sauce:** A quick glaze made from reducing soy sauce (or salt/water reduction if no soy), vinegar, sugar, and lots of ginger.
**The Layering:**
1.  **Base:** Steaming white rice.
2.  **Fry:** Chicken crisped in oil -> Add onions/ginger -> Add cabbage/corn -> Toss with glaze.

## Variant B: "Creamy Garlic-Ginger" (The White Sauce Version)
**The Vibe:** Rich, creamy, and tangy. Almost like a stroganoff but lighter.
**The Twist:** Uses the **Cottage Cheese** to create a high-protein cream sauce.
**The Sauce:** Blend Cottage Cheese + Garlic + Vinegar + splash of water until smooth. Pour over the hot skillet at the very end (off heat so it doesn't split).
**The Layering:**
1.  **Base:** Rice mixed with sautéed **Onions**.
2.  **Fry:** Chicken + Cabbage + Corn sautéed with ginger until soft/wilted.
