# Creamy Garlic-Ginger Chicken & Rice Skillet 🍗🍚

A high-protein, comforting skillet meal that uses a blended cottage cheese "white sauce" for incredible creaminess without the heavy cream.

*   **Prep time:** 10 mins
*   **Cook time:** 15 mins
*   **Total time:** 25 mins
*   **Servings:** 2-4

### Ingredients

**The Base:**
*   1 cup Rice (cooked according to package instructions)
*   1 tbsp Butter or Oil

**The Skillet:**
*   2 cups Pre-cooked Chicken Cubes (thawed)
*   1/2 head Green Cabbage, shredded
*   1 cup Canned Corn, drained
*   1 Yellow Onion, diced
*   2 tbsp Fresh Ginger, minced or grated
*   Salt and Pepper to taste

**The "High-Protein White Sauce":**
*   1 cup Cottage Cheese
*   2 cloves Garlic, peeled
*   1 tbsp White Vinegar
*   2-3 tbsp Water (to reach desired consistency)
*   Pinch of Salt

**Garnish:**
*   3-4 Radishes, thinly sliced

### Mise-en-place
1.  **Rice:** Start the rice first if not using pre-cooked.
2.  **Veggies:** Shred the cabbage, dice the onion, grate the ginger.
3.  **Sauce:** Blend the cottage cheese, garlic, vinegar, and water until completely smooth. Set aside at room temp.
4.  **Chicken:** Ensure chicken cubes are thawed and ready to sear.

### Timeline
*   **0-15 mins:** Start rice. While it simmers, prep all vegetables and blend the sauce.
*   **15-20 mins:** Heat a large skillet with oil/butter. Sauté onions and ginger until fragrant. Add chicken cubes and sear until edges are slightly crispy.
*   **20-25 mins:** Toss in cabbage and corn. Sauté for 3-5 mins until cabbage is wilted but still has a slight bite. 
*   **Finish:** Remove skillet from heat. Fold in the cooked rice. Pour the blended "White Sauce" over everything and toss gently to coat. (Do not boil the sauce or the cottage cheese may split).
*   **Serve:** Top with sliced radishes for crunch and peppery heat.

### Flavor Layer
The ginger provides a bright, sharp heat that cuts through the rich creaminess of the cottage cheese. The vinegar in the sauce provides a "tang" similar to sour cream.

### Kid Submeal
Separate a portion of chicken, rice, and corn before adding the ginger and cabbage if the "green things" or the "spicy ginger" are an issue.
