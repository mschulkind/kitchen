## Meal 1: Thick & Hearty Chicken & Masa Dumplings (Chochoyotes) Stew 🍲

This rustic and comforting stew features tender chicken, purple potatoes, smoky poblanos, and delightful masa harina dumplings (chochoyotes), all thickened into a rich, satisfying meal. We'll use your green onions/chives and onion powder for a robust onion flavor, and wilt in some garden Swiss chard for extra goodness.

**Yields:** 4-6 servings
**Prep time:** 30 minutes
**Cook time:** 1 hour

### Ingredients:

**For the Chochoyotes (Masa Dumplings):**
*   1 ¾ cups `Masa Harina`
*   1 ½ cups warm water (adjust as needed)
*   1 teaspoon `Salt`
*   2 tablespoons olive oil (from pantry)
*   ¼ cup chopped `Chives` or `Green Onions` (from garden)

**For the Stew:**
*   2 tablespoons olive oil (from pantry)
*   1 tablespoon `Onion Powder` (from pantry)
*   3-4 cloves `Garlic`, minced (from pantry)
*   1 large `Poblano Pepper`, roasted, peeled, seeded, and chopped (from garden)
*   1 cup chopped `Tomatoes` (from garden)
*   6 cups `Pork Broth` (from freezer)
*   1 lb `Purple Potatoes`, cut into ½ inch cubes (from pantry)
*   2 cups `Cubed Cooked Chicken` (from freezer)
*   1 teaspoon `Cumin` (from pantry)
*   1 teaspoon `Chili Powder` (from pantry)
*   1 teaspoon `Oregano` (from pantry)
*   ½ teaspoon `Salt`, plus more to taste
*   ¼ teaspoon `Black Pepper`
*   2 cups `Swiss Chard`, roughly chopped (from garden)
*   Fresh `Chives` or `Green Onions` for garnish (from garden)

### Instructions:

**1. Prepare the Chochoyotes:**
    *   In a medium bowl, combine the masa harina, salt, and olive oil. Mix until it resembles coarse sand.
    *   Gradually add the warm water, mixing until a soft, pliable dough forms. Stir in the chopped chives or green onions.
    *   Knead the dough for a couple of minutes, then cover with a damp towel and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
    *   To shape, take small pieces of dough (about 1 tablespoon), roll into balls, and press a deep indentation into the center with your thumb. Set aside.

**2. Start the Stew Base:**
    *   In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion powder and minced garlic, and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
    *   Add the chopped roasted poblano pepper and chopped tomatoes. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    *   Pour in the pork broth. Add the cubed purple potatoes, cumin, chili powder, oregano, salt, and black pepper. Bring to a simmer.

**3. Cook Chicken and Chochoyotes:**
    *   Add the cubed cooked chicken to the simmering stew. Continue to simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until potatoes are fork-tender.
    *   Ensure the stew is at a gentle simmer. Carefully drop the chochoyotes into the stew, one at a time. Cook for 10-15 minutes, or until they float and are cooked through. Avoid over-stirring.

**4. Finish the Stew:**
    *   Stir in the chopped Swiss chard and cook until just wilted, about 2-3 minutes.
    *   Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. For a thicker stew, you can gently mash some of the potatoes against the side of the pot.
    *   Ladle into bowls and garnish with fresh chives or green onions.
