# Ingredient Verification: 2-Meal Plan

Here is the consolidated ingredient list for both meals: the **Thick & Hearty Chochoyotes Stew** and the **Spicy & Brothy Chicken & Poblano Soup**. 

Please review the list and let me know if there are any inaccuracies or substitutions you'd like to make. I've pre-checked (`[x]`) the items I believe you have based on your pantry, freezer, and garden stock lists.

### Produce
- [ ] Onion (You have `chives` and `green onions` in the garden, and `onion powder` in the pantry, which we can use as substitutes.)
- [x] Garlic (`Whole garlic`)
- [x] Purple Potatoes (`Potatoes`)
- [x] Poblano Peppers
- [x] Tomatoes
- [x] Swiss Chard
- [x] Habanero Pepper
- [ ] Limes (You have `lemons` in the fridge, which can be used as a substitute for acidity.)

### Pantry
- [x] Masa Harina

### Freezer

### Spices
- [x] Cumin

- [x] Black Pepper
- [x] Onion Powder (Adding this to the list since you have it and it will be used as an onion substitute)

### Potential New Ingredients
- None! We can still make both of these meals entirely from your existing stock by using the suggested substitutes. 🎉
