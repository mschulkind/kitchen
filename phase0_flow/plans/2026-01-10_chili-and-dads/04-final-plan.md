# Final Meal Plan: The "Latent Starch" Protocol 🥔

**Date:** January 10 - January 14, 2026
**Theme:** High-Fiber, High-Protein, Resistant Starch (Cook-Cool-Reheat).

## The Strategy
*   **The "Cold-Chain" Rule:** Potatoes are cooked 24 hours in advance (or cooled to room temp) to maximize resistant starch.
*   **No Mash/No Blend:** All starches are left in chunks or whole forms to lower glycemic impact.
*   **The "Buffer":** Every meal pairs starch with a 2:1 ratio of fibrous vegetables.
