## Instructions

1.  **Sear the Beef:** Season the beef cubes generously with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Sear beef in batches until deeply browned on all sides. Remove and set aside.
2.  **Sauté Aromatics:** Lower heat to medium. Add onions to the pot (add a splash more oil if dry) and sauté for 5 minutes until translucent. Add minced garlic and spices (chili powder, paprika, cumin, oregano) and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
3.  **Simmer:** Deglaze the pot with a splash of broth, scraping up the browned bits. Return the beef and any juices to the pot. Add the remaining broth, tomatoes, and rinsed black beans. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 2-2.5 hours until beef is tender but not shredding.
4.  **Prepare the Buffer:** 10 minutes before serving, sauté the chopped kale and sliced garlic in a separate pan with a little oil until wilted but bright green. Season with salt.
5.  **Serve:** Place the cooled/tepid potato half in the bowl. Ladle hot chili over it (or next to it). Pile the garlic kale on the side. Top generously with cilantro.
