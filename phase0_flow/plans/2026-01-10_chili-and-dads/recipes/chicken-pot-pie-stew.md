## Ingredients

- 2-3 lbs **Chicken Thighs** (Bone-in, Skin-on for flavor, or Boneless/Skinless for ease)
- 4 large **Russet Potatoes**, peeled and cut into large 1.5-inch chunks
- 3 **Carrots**, peeled and sliced into thick rounds
- 3 stalks **Celery**, sliced
- 1 large **Yellow Onion**, chopped
- 4 cups **Pork Broth** (or Chicken Broth)
- 1 cup **Frozen Peas**
- 1 teaspoon **Dried Thyme** (or fresh sprigs)
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 tablespoons **Cornstarch** (mixed with water) to thicken (optional)
- **Salt** and **Black Pepper** to taste

## Instructions

1.  **Sear Chicken:** Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper. In a large soup pot, sear skin-side down over medium-high heat until golden and crispy (about 5-6 mins). Flip and sear 2 mins more. Remove chicken and set aside. (If using boneless, sear cubes until browned).
2.  **Build Base:** Discard all but 2 tbsp of fat. Add onions, carrots, and celery. Sauté for 5 minutes.
3.  **Simmer:** Pour in the broth and scrape the bottom of the pot. Add the thyme, bay leaf, and potato chunks. Return chicken to the pot (nestle them in). Bring to a boil, reduce to low, cover, and simmer for 35-40 minutes.
4.  **Finish:** Check that potatoes are fork-tender (these are your "dumplings"). Remove chicken, shred the meat (discard bones/skin if preferred), and return meat to pot.
5.  **Thicken & Buffer:** Stir in the frozen peas. If you want a thicker "pot pie" texture, stir in the cornstarch slurry and simmer for 2 minutes until glossy and thickened.
6.  **Cool for Travel:** Let the pot cool uncovered for 30 minutes before packing. This helps the potatoes firm up so they don't disintegrate during the drive.
