Here are 5 different ways to view the execution of this recipe. Choose the one that fits your cooking style best.

## Format 1: The "Mise-en-place" & Execution Flow

*Best for: Ensuring you have everything ready before you start the heat.*

**Mise-en-place:**

- **The Meat:** 2-3 lbs Chicken Thighs (Bone-in/Skin-on, or boneless).
- **The "Mirepoix":** 1 Onion (chopped), 3 Carrots (rounds), 3 Celery stalks (sliced).
- **The Liquid:** 4 cups Pork (or Chicken) Broth.
- **The Bulk:** 4 large Russet Potatoes (1.5" chunks), 1 cup Frozen Peas.
- **Aromatics/Thickener:** Thyme, Bay Leaf, 2 tbsp Cornstarch (slurry).

**Execution:**

1.  **Sear:** Skin-side down in soup pot (med-high) until crispy golden. Flip, sear 2m. Remove.
2.  **Sauté:** Drain excess fat (keep 2 tbsp). Cook onion, carrot, celery (5m).
3.  **Combine:** Add broth, potatoes, herbs. Nestle chicken back in.
4.  **Simmer:** Boil, then low cover for 35-40m.
5.  **Shred:** Remove chicken, discard bones/skin, shred meat, return to pot.
6.  **Finish:** Add peas. Stir in cornstarch slurry if you want it thick.
7.  **Cool:** Let sit 30m before packing/serving (firms up potatoes).

## Format 2: The "Flavor Layers" (Step-by-Step Build)

*Best for: Understanding the sequential build-up of flavors.*

1.  **FOND Layer:** Rendering chicken fat creates the cooking medium and leaves "fond" (brown bits) for the soup base.
2.  **SWEET VEG Layer:** The carrot/onion/celery trio provides the classic sweet savory vegetal base.
3.  **HERBAL Layer:** Thyme and Bay Leaf infuse the broth during the simmer, giving it that "homestyle" smell.
4.  **STARCH Layer:** The potatoes release starch as they cook, thickening the broth naturally. The cornstarch finish makes it glossy and gravy-like.
5.  **FRESH Layer:** Peas are added last to keep them popping fresh, not mushy greens.

## Format 3: The "Chef's Shorthand" (Tactical)

*Best for: Quick glances while cooking.*

- **Sear** chicken (skin down). Remove.
- **Sweat** mirepoix (onion/carrot/celery).
- **Add** broth, potatoes, herbs.
- **Return** chicken.
- **Simmer** covered 40m.
- **Pull** chicken -> Shred -> Return.
- **Add** peas & thickener.
- **Cool** 30m (crucial for travel).

## Format 4: The "Timeline" (Parallel Processor)

*Best for: Optimization and multi-tasking.*

| Time | Action | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T-60** | **Sear** | Render chicken fat. Golden skin. |
| **T-50** | **Base** | Add chopped veg to pot. |
| **T-45** | **Simmer** | Liquids + Potatoes + Chicken in. Cover. |
| **T-05** | **Check** | Potatoes tender? |
| **T-05** | **Process** | Shred chicken meat. Discard bones. |
| **T-00** | **Thicken** | Add peas + slurry. Simmer 2m. |
| **T+30** | **Pack** | Cool down prevents potato disintegration. |

## Format 5: The "Sensory Script" (Audio-Visual)

*Best for: Cooking by feel and intuition.*

- **LOOK:** Chicken skin should be deep gold, not pale yellow, before flipping.
- **SMELL:** It smells like Sunday dinner when the thyme hits the hot chicken fat.
- **TOUCH:** Potatoes should yield to a knife tip like butter (dumpling texture).
- **LOOK:** The final sauce should be glossy and coat the back of a spoon (nappe), not watery.
- **TASTE:** The broth should be rich and savory; if it tastes flat, it needs more salt or a squeeze of lemon.
