## Format 2: The "Flavor Layers" (Step-by-Step Build)

*Best for: Understanding the sequential build-up of flavors.*

1.  **ROASTED Layer:** The side of Brussels sprouts provides caramelized bitterness to cut the creamy soup.
2.  **SAVORY Layer:** Onion, celery, and seafood stock build the traditional chowder backbone.
3.  **SPICE Layer:** Old Bay adds celery salt/paprika/hard spices that define "seafood chowder."
4.  **CREAM Layer:** Coconut milk provides rich, dairy-free fat that coats the palate.
5.  **DELICATE Layer:** The fish is poached gently at the end so it remains flaky and moist, not rubbery.

## Format 5: The "Sensory Script" (Audio-Visual)

*Best for: Cooking by feel and intuition.*

- **SMELL:** Sweet coconut mixed with the savory brine of the seafood stock.
- **TOUCH:** Potatoes should crush easily against the roof of your mouth.
- **LOOK:** The soup should be creamy white/yellow. Brussels sprouts should be dark brown/crispy.
- **TECHNIQUE:** Do not boil the fish vigorously! It will disintegrate. Gentle poaching keeps the chunks distinct.
