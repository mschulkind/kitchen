- 1 **White Onion**, diced
- 1 cup **Corn** (Frozen or Canned)

## Instructions

1.  **Roast Side:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss Brussels sprouts with oil and salt. Roast for 20-25 minutes until crispy. (Do this while soup cooks).
2.  **Base:** In a soup pot, sauté onion and celery in a little oil until soft (5 mins).
3.  **Simmer Potatoes:** Add the stock, potatoes, and Old Bay. Bring to a boil and cook for 10-12 minutes until potatoes are just tender.
4.  **Creamy Finish:** Pour in the coconut milk and corn. Bring to a gentle simmer.
5.  **Poach Fish:** Gently lay the Pollock chunks into the hot soup. Cover and turn off the heat (or keep on very low). Let sit for 5-7 minutes. The residual heat will cook the fish perfectly without breaking it apart.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle gently to keep fish chunks intact. Serve with the crispy Brussels sprouts on the side.
