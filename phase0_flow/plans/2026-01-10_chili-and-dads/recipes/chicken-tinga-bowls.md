## Format 2: The "Flavor Layers" (Step-by-Step Build)

*Best for: Understanding the sequential build-up of flavors.*

1.  **CHAR Layer:** Searing the chicken first gives texture before it gets bathed in sauce.
2.  **SMOKE & HEAT Layer:** The Chipotle/Salsa creates the warm, spicy profile that permeates the meat.
3.  **COOL CREAM Layer:** The potato salad (with mayo/corn) provides a starchy, cooling textural contrast to the spicy meat.
4.  **CRUNCH Layer:** The raw cabbage and radishes act as the fresh palate cleanser against the soft chicken and soft potato.
5.  **ACID Layer:** A final squeeze of lime brightens the heavy sauce.

## Format 5: The "Sensory Script" (Audio-Visual)

*Best for: Cooking by feel and intuition.*

- **SOUND:** Loud searing initially, quieting down to a gentle "bloop bloop" simmer when sauce is added.
- **SMELL:** Smoky chipotle and warm corn tortillas (even without the tortillas, the smell is there!).
- **TOUCH:** Contrast is key here—Hot saucy chicken vs. Cold creamy potato vs. Crisp raw cabbage.
- **LOOK:** Deep red chicken, bright yellow/white salad, pale green cabbage base. Colorful!
