## Format 2: The "Flavor Layers" (Step-by-Step Build)

*Best for: Understanding the sequential build-up of flavors.*

1. **BLOOM Layer:** Frying the curry powder and turmeric in the oil "wakes up" the spices, making them potent rather than dusty.
2. **RICHNESS Layer:** Coconut milk fats carry the spice flavor to every corner of the dish.
3. **EARTH Layer:** Chickpeas and potato skins provide a deep, grounding earthiness and texture.
4. **FRESH Layer:** The spinach adds color and iron; the lime juice cuts through the coconut fat to make the flavors "pop."

## Format 5: The "Sensory Script" (Audio-Visual)

*Best for: Cooking by feel and intuition.*

- **LOOK:** The oil should turn vibrant yellow/orange when the turmeric hits it.
- **SMELL:** Warm ginger and curry leaf smell filling the room.
- **TOUCH:** Potatoes should be soft all the way through; chickpeas stay slightly firm.
- **TASTE:** Taste before the lime, then after. You should notice the heavy coconut flavor suddenly becoming "lighter" and cleaner.
