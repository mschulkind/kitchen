# Meal Plan Options

Here are 4 "High-Latency" meal plan options. I have removed all mashed/blended potatoes to prevent glucose spikes.

**The "Resistant Starch" Protocol:**
*   **Structure:** Potatoes are kept **Whole**, **Diced**, or **Wedged** (skin-on).
*   **Chemistry:** Potatoes are often cooked, cooled, and reheated (or eaten cool) to maximize resistant starch.
*   **Buffering:** Every potato serving is paired with a specific 2:1 volume of fibrous vegetables.
