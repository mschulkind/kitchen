## Recipes & Instructions

### Meal 1: Authentic Chicken Cacciatore
*A hunter-style stew with deep tomato flavors and wine.*

**Ingredients:**
*   4-6 Chicken Thighs (bone-in, skin-on preferred for flavor, but remove skin before eating for heart health if desired)
*   2 tbsp Olive Oil
*   1 Onion, diced
*   2 Carrots, diced
*   2 stalks Celery, diced
*   4 cloves Garlic, minced
*   1/2 cup Red Wine
*   1 (28 oz) can Whole Peeled Tomatoes, crushed by hand
*   1 tsp Dried Oregano
*   1 sprig Fresh Rosemary (or 1/2 tsp dried)
*   Salt & Pepper
*   *Serve with:* Your preferred pasta or just crusty bread.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Sear Chicken:** Pat chicken dry and season generously with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear chicken until golden brown (about 5 mins per side). Remove and set aside.
2.  **Sauté Veggies:** In the same pot, add onion, carrots, and celery. Cook until softened (8-10 mins). Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.
3.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the red wine, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Let it simmer for 2-3 minutes to reduce slightly.
4.  **Simmer:** Add the hand-crushed tomatoes (with juices), oregano, and rosemary. Return chicken to the pot, nestling it into the sauce. Cover and simmer on low for 30-40 minutes, or until chicken is tender.
5.  **Finish:** Uncover and simmer for 5-10 more minutes to thicken the sauce if needed. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with fresh parsley.

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Pat cod filets dry and season lightly with salt and pepper.
2.  **Make Sauce:** In an oven-safe skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Sauté garlic for 1 minute. Add tomatoes, capers, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Simmer for 10-15 minutes to thicken slightly.
3.  **Bake:** Nestle the cod filets into the sauce. Spoon some sauce over the fish. Transfer skillet to the oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until fish flakes easily with a fork.

### Meal 3: Creamy White Bean Pasta e Fagioli
*A comforting soup that uses pureed beans for a rich, creamy texture without dairy.*

**Ingredients:**
*   1 tbsp Olive Oil
*   1 Onion, diced
*   2 Carrots, diced
*   2 stalks Celery, diced
*   3 cloves Garlic, minced
*   1 (14.5 oz) can Fire Roasted Tomatoes
*   2 (15 oz) cans Cannellini Beans (rinsed and drained)
*   4 cups Pork Broth (from freezer)
*   1 cup Small Pasta (ditalini, elbows, or shells)
*   1 tsp Dried Rosemary
*   Salt & Pepper

**Instructions:**
1.  **Sauté Base:** Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté until tender (8-10 mins). Add garlic and rosemary; cook for 1 minute.
2.  **Build Soup:** Add the can of tomatoes and the pork broth. Stir to combine.
3.  **Creaminess Trick:** In a blender (or using an immersion blender in a separate bowl), puree **one can** of the beans with a ladleful of the hot broth until smooth. Add this puree to the pot.
4.  **Simmer:** Add the **second can** of whole beans to the pot. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes.
5.  **Cook Pasta:** Add the pasta directly to the soup and cook until al dente (usually 8-10 mins). The pasta will release starch and thicken the soup further.
6.  **Finish:** Taste and season generously with salt and pepper. If it's too thick, add a splash of water.
