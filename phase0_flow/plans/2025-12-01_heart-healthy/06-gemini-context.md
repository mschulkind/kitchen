## Recipes & Instructions

### Meal 1: Authentic Chicken Cacciatore
*A hunter-style stew with deep tomato flavors and wine.*

**Ingredients:**
*   4-6 Chicken Thighs (bone-in, skin-on preferred for flavor)
*   2 tbsp Olive Oil
*   1 Onion, diced
*   2 Carrots, diced
*   2 stalks Celery, diced
*   4 cloves Garlic, minced
*   1/2 cup Red Wine
*   1 (28 oz) can Whole Peeled Tomatoes, crushed by hand
*   1 tsp Dried Oregano
*   1 sprig Fresh Rosemary (or 1/2 tsp dried)
*   Salt & Pepper
*   *Serve with:* Your preferred pasta or just crusty bread.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Sear Chicken:** Pat chicken dry and season generously with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear chicken until golden brown (about 5 mins per side). Remove and set aside.
2.  **Sauté Veggies:** In the same pot, add onion, carrots, and celery. Cook until softened (8-10 mins). Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.
3.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the red wine, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Let it simmer for 2-3 minutes to reduce slightly.
4.  **Simmer:** Add the hand-crushed tomatoes (with juices), oregano, and rosemary. Return chicken to the pot, nestling it into the sauce. Cover and simmer on low for 30-40 minutes, or until chicken is tender.
5.  **Finish:** Uncover and simmer for 5-10 more minutes to thicken the sauce if needed. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with fresh parsley.

### Meal 3: Ultimate Smoky Pasta e Fagioli
*A rich, stew-like version built on smoked meat and a deep tomato base. Best made a day ahead.*

**Ingredients:**
*   1-2 Smoked Sausages, sliced (from freezer)
*   1 Onion, diced
*   2 Carrots, diced
*   2 stalks Celery, diced
*   4-5 cloves Garlic, whole peeled
*   1-2 tbsp Tomato Paste
*   1 (28 oz) can Whole Peeled Tomatoes, hand-crushed
*   2 (15 oz) cans Cannellini Beans (rinsed and drained)
*   4 cups Pork Broth (from freezer)
*   1 cup Ditalini Pasta
*   1/2 tsp Red Pepper Flakes
*   1 tsp Dried Rosemary (or 1 fresh sprig)
*   Parmesan Rind (optional)
*   Salt & Pepper

**Instructions:**
1.  **Render:** In a large pot, sauté sliced sausage until browned and fat is released.
2.  **Sauté Base:** Add onion, carrots, and celery directly to the sausage fat (add a splash of oil if needed). Cook until soft (8-10 mins).
3.  **Deepen:** Add the **whole garlic cloves**, **red pepper flakes**, and **tomato paste**. Fry the paste for 2 minutes until it turns a dark rust color.
4.  **Simmer:** Add the hand-crushed tomatoes (and their juices), pork broth, rosemary, and parmesan rind. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low. Simmer for 20-30 minutes.
5.  **Make Ahead (Recommended):** Stop here. Let cool and store in the fridge overnight.
6.  **Finish (Day Of):** Reheat soup to a simmer. Add the ditalini and beans. Cook until pasta is al dente (about 10 mins). The pasta will thicken the soup naturally. Season with salt, pepper, and a splash of balsamic vinegar before serving.
