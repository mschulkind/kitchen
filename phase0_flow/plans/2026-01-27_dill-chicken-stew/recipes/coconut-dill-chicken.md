# Provisional Recipe: Coconut Dill Chicken Stew

**Target Time:** 30 Minutes

## Ingredients (Mise en Place)
- **Protein:** Braised Chicken Thighs (thaw quickly under cold water or add directly if chopped small).
- **Aromatics:** Onion (diced), Garlic (minced), Ginger (grated/powder).
- **Liquid:** 1 can Coconut Milk.
- **Veg:** Frozen Spinach (or fresh greens), Carrots (diced small for speed).
- **Herbs:** FRESH DILL (lots of it).
- **Starch:** Rice (cook separately in parallel).

## Flavor Layer Strategy
1.  **Sauté:** Onion/Carrot + Ginger + Turmeric (bloom spices).
2.  **Simmer:** Coconut milk + Chicken (braised means it's already cooked, just needs heating/flavor melding).
3.  **Finish:** Spinach (wilts instantly) + Fresh Dill (add at the very end to keep flavor bright) + Lime/Vinegar splash (acid needed to cut fat).

## Kid Submeal Note
- Reserve plain rice.
- If the stew is too "herby" or spicy, serve the chicken pieces rinsed slightly with plain rice and a side of fruit/veg.
- The coconut sauce itself is usually very kid-friendly (sweet/creamy).

## Timeline (30 Mins)
- **00-05:** Start Rice. Dice Onion/Carrot.
- **05-10:** Sauté Aromatics in pot.
- **10-15:** Add Coconut Milk & Chicken. Simmer.
- **15-25:** Let flavors meld. (Prepare Garnish/Table).
- **25-30:** Stir in Spinach & Dill. Season & Serve.
