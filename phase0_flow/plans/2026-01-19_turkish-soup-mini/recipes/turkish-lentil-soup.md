## Format 2: The "Flavor Layers" (Step-by-Step Build)

*Best for: Understanding the sequential build-up of flavors.*

1.  **SWEET & EARTHY Base (Main):** The onions, carrots, and potatoes provide a sweet vegetable foundation, while the red lentils add the earthy protein backbone.
2.  **BLOOMED SPICE Layer (Main):** Frying the tomato paste and spices (cumin/coriander) in oil unlocks fat-soluble flavors that boiling water alone cannot release.
3.  **CREAMY TEXTURE Layer (Main):** Blending the cooked potato and lentils creates a natural, dairy-free creaminess that coats the palate.
4.  **BRIGHT ACID Punch (Side & Finish):** The lime juice in the salad and fresh lemon squeeze in the soup cut through the starchy thickness, creating a palate-cleansing effect between bites.
5.  **SPICY FAT Finish (Garnish):** The chili-infused oil dribbled on top provides heat and a rich mouthfeel contrast to the acidic soup.

## Format 5: The "Sensory Script" (Audio-Visual)

*Best for: Cooking by feel and intuition.*

-   **SMELL:** The kitchen should smell warm and toasted (cumin) when the spices hit the oil for the soup.
-   **LOOK (Side):** The salad should glisten with lime juice; the colors should be jewel-like red and green.
-   **SOUND:** The quiet bubble of the soup simmer is replaced by the aggressive "whirrr" of the immersion blender.
-   **TOUCH:** The lentils in the soup should be completely disintegrated; the potato soft enough to mash.
-   **TASTE:** The soup is heavy and earthy; the salad provides a sharp, crunchy "snap" that wakes up your tongue.

### Kid Submeal

-   **The Catch:** Before blending the soup, fish out several chunks of potato and carrot. Serve these "nuggets" plain with a side of cheese toast or pita bread.
-   **The Side:** Serve cucumber slices plain (pre-dressing).
