# Velveted Beef & Broccoli Stir-Fry 🥦

*Provisional Recipe for Ingredient Verification*

### Ingredients
- [ ] **Freezer Stock:** 1 lb Chuck Stew Meat (sliced thin while semi-frozen)
- [ ] 2 large heads Broccoli (cut into small florets)
- [ ] 1 bunch Scallions (sliced)
- [ ] 1 tbsp Fresh Ginger (grated)
- [ ] 3 cloves Garlic (minced)
- [ ] 1/2 cup Soy Sauce
- [ ] 1 tbsp Sesame Oil
- [ ] 2 tbsp Brown Sugar or Honey
- [ ] 1/2 tsp Baking Soda (for velveting)
- [ ] 1 tbsp Cornstarch (for sauce and velveting)
- [ ] 2 cups Brown or White Rice (cooked)
- [ ] Neutral Oil (for high-heat frying)

### Flavor Layers
1. **The Texture (Velveting):** Toss thin beef slices with baking soda, cornstarch, and a splash of soy sauce. Let sit 20m, then rinse and pat dry (or skip rinse for faster flow if using small amounts). This ensures the stew meat is tender.
2. **The Maillard:** Sear beef in batches in a smoking hot pan until charred but not overcooked.
3. **The Sauce:** Whisk soy sauce, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, and sweetener.
4. **The Crunch:** Stir-fry broccoli until bright green but still snappy.

### Kid Submeal
- Plain beef strips (set aside before sauce) + plain rice + steamed broccoli (no sauce).
