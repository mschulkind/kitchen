## Format 1: The "Mise-en-place" & Execution Flow

*Best for: Ensuring you have everything ready before you start the heat.*

**Mise-en-place (Main & Companion):**

- **The Main (Beef) Prep:**
  - Slice 1 lb Chuck Stew Meat (1/8" thin against grain).
  - Mix **Velvet Marinade:** 1/2 tsp Baking Soda, 1 tbsp Cornstarch, 1 tbsp Soy Sauce.
- **The Companion (Rice):** 2 cups Jasmine Rice, 3 cups Water (or per cooker instructions).
- **The Main (Veg & Sauce) Prep:**
  - Cut 2 large heads Broccoli (bite-sized florets).
  - Slice 1 bunch Scallions.
  - Grate 1 tbsp Ginger.
  - Mince 3 cloves Garlic.
  - Mix **Sauce:** 1/2 cup Soy Sauce, 1 tbsp Sesame Oil, 1 tbsp Brown Sugar, 1 tsp Cornstarch.

**Execution (Interleaved):**

1.  **Velvet (Main):** Toss sliced beef with Velvet Marinade. **Let sit 20m.**
2.  **Start Companion:** IMMEDIATELY start the rice (stove or cooker). This takes ~20m, exactly the velvet time.
3.  **Prep:** While beef sits and rice cooks, chop broccoli, ginger, garlic, scallions, and mix sauce.
4.  **Sear (Main):** Heat 2 tbsp oil in wok (smoking hot). Sear beef in batches. Remove.
5.  **Veg (Main):** Add oil. Steam-fry broccoli (splash of water, cover 1m) until bright green.
6.  **Finish Main:** Return beef. Add aromatics. Pour sauce. Toss 30s.
7.  **Serve:** Rice should beep/finish just as the beef is done. Serve immediately.

## Format 2: The "Flavor Layers" (Step-by-Step Build)

*Best for: Understanding the sequential build-up of flavors.*

1.  **NEUTRAL Canvas (Companion):** The plain jasmine rice acts as a neutral sponge, essential for soaking up the intense salty/savory sauce.
2.  **VELVET Texture Layer (Main):** The baking soda alters the pH of the beef during the 20m rest, creating a unique "bouncy" tenderness.
3.  **MAILLARD Layer (Main):** The high-heat sear creates savory crust on the beef, essential for depth before the sauce is added.
4.  **FRESH Veg Layer (Main):** Rapidly cooking the broccoli preserves its crunch and chlorophyl (bright green), contrasting the soft meat and fluffy rice.
5.  **UMAMI GLAZE Layer (Main):** The soy/cornstarch sauce binds the beef and broccoli together, coating them in a glossy sheen that drips onto the rice.

## Format 5: The "Sensory Script" (Audio-Visual)

*Best for: Cooking by feel and intuition.*

-   **TOUCH:** Beef slices feel slippery (cornstarch) before cooking. Rice should be fluffy, separate grains, not mushy.
-   **SOUND:** The wok should "scream" when the beef hits it. The rice cooker "click" or "beep" serves as your 5-minute warning to start the stir-fry.
-   **LOOK:** Broccoli goes from dull green to vivid "highlighter" green. Stop cooking then!
-   **SMELL:** The sharp, pungent aroma of searing ginger and garlic signals the dish is almost done.
-   **TASTE:** The sauce is aggressive; eating a piece of broccoli alone might be salty, but eaten with the plain rice, it's perfect.

### Kid Submeal

-   **Simple Stir-Fry:** Reserve several strips of beef after searing (before the sauce) and some steamed broccoli. Serve with plain rice and a little soy sauce for dipping.
