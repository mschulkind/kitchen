# Velveted Beef & Broccoli Stir-Fry 🥦

*Tender beef without the braise. Ready in 35 mins.*

### Ingredients
- **Freezer Stock:** 1 lb Chuck Stew Meat (sliced into 1/8" thin strips while semi-frozen)
- 2 large heads Broccoli (cut into small bite-sized florets)
- 1 bunch Scallions (sliced)
- 1 tbsp Fresh Ginger (grated)
- 3 cloves Garlic (minced)
- **The Sauce:** 1/2 cup Soy Sauce, 1 tbsp Sesame Oil, 1 tbsp Brown Sugar or Honey, 1 tsp Cornstarch.
- **The Velvet:** 1/2 tsp Baking Soda, 1 tbsp Cornstarch, 1 tbsp Soy Sauce.
- 2 cups Rice (cooked)
- Neutral Oil (Canola or Veg)

### Execution
1. **Velvet (20m):** Toss the thin beef slices with the "Velvet" ingredients (baking soda, cornstarch, soy sauce). Let it sit for 20 mins while you prep the broccoli and ginger. 
   *Note:* No need to rinse if slices are thin; the baking soda will break down the fibers and the cornstarch creates a silky coating.
2. **The Sear (5m):** Heat 2 tbsp oil in a wok or large skillet until smoking. Sear beef in two batches. Don't crowd the pan! We want a hard char. Remove beef.
3. **The Veg (4m):** Add more oil if needed. Stir-fry broccoli florets with a splash of water/broth (steam-fry) until bright green and tender-crisp.
4. **The Finish (2m):** Return beef to pan. Add ginger, garlic, and scallions. Pour in "The Sauce" mixture. Toss until the sauce thickens and coats everything in a glossy sheen.
5. **Serve:** Pile over warm rice.

### Kid Submeal
- **Simple Stir-Fry:** Reserve several strips of beef after searing (before the sauce) and some steamed broccoli. Serve with plain rice and a little soy sauce for dipping.
