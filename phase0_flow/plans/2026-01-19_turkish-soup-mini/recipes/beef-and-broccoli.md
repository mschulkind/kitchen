## Format 1: The "Mise-en-place" & Execution Flow

*Best for: Ensuring you have everything ready before you start the heat.*

**Mise-en-place:**

- **The Protein:** 1 lb Chuck Stew Meat (sliced 1/8" thin against grain).
- **The Velvet Marinade:** 1/2 tsp Baking Soda, 1 tbsp Cornstarch, 1 tbsp Soy Sauce.
- **The Veg:** 2 large heads Broccoli (small bite-sized florets), 1 bunch Scallions (sliced).
- **Aromatics:** 1 tbsp Fresh Ginger (grated), 3 cloves Garlic (minced).
- **The Sauce:** 1/2 cup Soy Sauce, 1 tbsp Sesame Oil, 1 tbsp Brown Sugar (or Honey), 1 tsp Cornstarch.
- **Base:** 2 cups Rice (cooked), Neutral Oil (for frying).

**Execution:**

1. **Velvet (20m):** Toss thin beef slices with "Velvet" ingredients. Let sit 20m. Start rice now.
2. **The Sear (5m):** Heat 2 tbsp oil in wok/skillet until smoking. Sear beef in two batches for a hard char. Remove beef.
3. **The Veg (4m):** Add splash of oil. Stir-fry broccoli with a splash of water (cover briefly to steam) until bright green/tender-crisp.
4. **The Finish (2m):** Return beef to pan. Add ginger, garlic, and scallions. Toss 30s.
5. **Sauce:** Pour in mixed sauce ingredients. Toss until sauce bubbles, thickens, and coats everything glossily.
6. **Serve:** Pile over warm rice.

## Format 2: The "Flavor Layers" (Step-by-Step Build)

*Best for: Understanding the sequential build-up of flavors.*

1. **VELVET Texture Layer:** The baking soda alters the pH of the beef, preventing protein strands from tightening, resulting in a texture usually only found in Chinese restaurants.
2. **MAILLARD Layer:** The high-heat sear creates savory crust on the beef, essential for depth before the sauce is added.
3. **FRESH Veg Layer:** Rapidly cooking the broccoli preserves its crunch and chlorophyl (bright green), providing contrast to the soft meat.
4. **AROMATIC Burst:** Adding ginger and garlic *after* the meat prevents burning and ensures a fresh, spicy kick in the final seconds.
5. **UMAMI GLAZE Layer:** The soy/cornstarch sauce binds everything together, creating the signature glossy mouthfeel.

## Format 3: The "Chef's Shorthand" (Tactical)

## Format 4: The "Timeline" (Parallel Processor)

*Best for: Optimization and multi-tasking.*

| Time | Action | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T-0:35** | **Velvet** | Slice beef, toss w/ soda/starch. |
| **T-0:30** | **Rice** | Start rice cooker/pot. |
| **T-0:20** | **Prep** | Cut broccoli, grate ginger, mix sauce. |
| **T-0:10** | **Sear** | High heat. Brown beef. Remove. |
| **T-0:05** | **Veg** | Cook broccoli (crunchy). |
| **T-0:02** | **Sauce** | Add beef/aromatics/sauce. Thicken. |
| **T-0:00** | **Eat** | Serve immediately. |

## Format 5: The "Sensory Script" (Audio-Visual)

*Best for: Cooking by feel and intuition.*

- **TOUCH:** Beef slices should feel slippery (cornstarch slime) before cooking, but tender (not chewy) after.
- **SOUND:** The wok should "scream" when the beef hits it. If it sizzles gently, it's not hot enough.
- **LOOK:** Broccoli goes from dull green to vivid "highlighter" green. Stop cooking then!
- **SMELL:** The sharp, pungent aroma of searing ginger and garlic signals you have 30 seconds left before sauce.
- **TASTE:** The sauce should be salty-sweet velvet coating, not a soup.

### Kid Submeal
- **Simple Stir-Fry:** Reserve several strips of beef after searing (before the sauce) and some steamed broccoli. Serve with plain rice and a little soy sauce for dipping.
