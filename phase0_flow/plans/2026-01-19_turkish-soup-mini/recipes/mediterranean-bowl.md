# Mediterranean "Rainbow" Bowl 🌿

*Textural contrast and fresh herbs. Ready in 30 mins.*

### Ingredients
- 2 x **15.5oz cans Chickpeas** (rinsed and drained)
- 1 cup Quinoa or Couscous (cooked according to package)
- **Freezer Stock:** Fire Roasted Roots (thawed and re-seared in pan)
- 1 bag Spinach (5-8oz fresh base)
- 2 Persian Cucumbers (diced)
- 2 Vine Tomatoes (diced)
- 1/4 Red Onion (thinly sliced)
- **Dill-Yogurt Sauce:** 1 cup Greek Yogurt, 1/2 bunch Fresh Dill (chopped), 1 clove Garlic (minced), Lemon zest/juice.
- 1/2 bunch Fresh Mint (chopped for salad)
- Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- Salt, Pepper, Cumin (for chickpeas)

### Execution
1. **Crisp (10m):** Sauté chickpeas in a pan with olive oil, cumin, and salt over medium-high heat until slightly browned and "popping".
2. **Roots:** In the same pan (or separate), sear the thawed fire-roasted roots until they have some crispy Maillard edges.
3. **The Sauce:** Whisk yogurt, dill, minced garlic, lemon zest, and a pinch of salt.
4. **The Salad:** Toss cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion, and mint with a splash of oil and lemon juice.
5. **Assemble:** Start with a bed of spinach and quinoa. Top with separated piles of chickpeas, roots, and salad. Drizzle heavily with the Dill-Yogurt sauce.

### Kid Submeal
- **Rainbow Plate:** Keep everything separate. A pile of plain chickpeas, a pile of warm roots, cucumber slices, and a small bowl of yogurt "dip" on the side.
