# Meal Plan Request

**Start Date:** Monday, January 19, 2026
**Duration:** 3 Meals (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday)

## Specific Requests

- **Schedule:**
  - Monday (Today): Dinner.
  - Tuesday (Tomorrow): Dinner.
  - Thursday: Dinner.
- **Must-Have Recipe:** Turkish Lentil Soup (or similar).
- **Kids:** Design meals with a "submeal" for picky 4 and 7 year olds (deconstructed, simple elements).
- **Time Constraint:** **Max 60 mins total (Prep + Cook)**, ideally **under 45 mins**.
  -   *Note:* Estimates must include realistic prep time (e.g., chopping veggies).
  -   *Strategy:* Lean on quick-cooking proteins (fish, thin strips) or passive cooking (roasting) while prepping other items.
- **Flavor & Texture Goals:**
  -   **Complex Layers:** Even quick meals must have depth (acid finish, bloomed spices, fresh herbs).
  -   **Texture:** Meat must **never** be chewy or stringy.
  -   **Technique:** Avoid long braises (2hr+) to meet time constraints. Use techniques like **velveting** (baking soda marinade) for beef or **hard searing** for flavor without toughness.
  -   **Acid:** Liberal use of Lime/Lemon juice for brightening (e.g., Shirazi salad).

## Dietary Constraints & Architecture

1.  **"50-25-25" Ratio:** 50% non-starchy veg, 25% high-quality protein, 25% complex carb.
    -   *Strategy:* Use **hefty vegetable sides** to fill the 50% volume requirement reliably.
2.  **Fiber-to-Carb:** Fiber >= 1/5th of total carbs.
3.  **Protein:** 20-30g min per meal.
4.  **Starches:** Slow-release only (sourdough, al dente farro/quinoa, pre-cooked/chilled skin-on potatoes).
5.  **Texture/Umami:**
    -   No mushy textures (eggplant, mushrooms).
    -   Use Maillard reaction (roasting/searing).
    -   *Swaps:* Roasted zucchini/Brussels sprouts instead of mushrooms. Salted & seared squash instead of eggplant. Capers/Sharp Cheddar instead of olives.
