**PROMPT:**

I am about to cook the **Mediterranean "Rainbow" Bowl**. Please act as my expert culinary assistant and sous-chef.

Your goal is to help me execute this recipe perfectly, focusing on textural contrasts and fresh herb layers.

**Here is the recipe context:**

- **Key Techniques:** Pan-crisping chickpeas (cumin/salt), re-searing fire-roasted roots, and whisking a dill-yogurt sauce.
- **Dietary Goal:** 50% non-starchy veg (Spinach/Salad/Roots), 25% Protein (Chickpeas/Yogurt), 25% Complex Carb (Quinoa/Couscous).
- **Kid Factor:** I need to serve this as a "Rainbow Plate" with ingredients separated.

**My Preferences for this chat:**

1. Keep your answers concise and tactical.
2. If I ask about a substitution, prioritize flavor complexity and "snap" (no mushy textures).
3. Help me manage the timing so the warm elements (roots/chickpeas) hit the bowl at the same time as the cold salad.

**Here is the full recipe for your reference:**

- Fire Roasted Roots (thawed)
- 1 bag Spinach (5-8oz)

## Execution Steps
