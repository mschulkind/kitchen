**PROMPT:**

I am about to cook **Velveted Beef & Broccoli Stir-Fry**. Please act as my expert culinary assistant and sous-chef.

Your goal is to help me execute this recipe perfectly, specifically ensuring the beef is **tender and never chewy** using the velveting technique.

**Here is the recipe context:**

- **Key Techniques:** **Velveting** (Baking soda/cornstarch marinade), high-heat searing (Maillard reaction), and steam-frying broccoli for "highlighter green" color.
- **Dietary Goal:** 50% non-starchy veg (Broccoli - double volume), 25% Protein (Beef), 25% Complex Carb (Rice).
- **Kid Factor:** I need to reserve plain beef and broccoli before adding the final sauce.

**My Preferences for this chat:**

1. Keep your answers concise and tactical.
2. **CRITICAL:** Help me ensure the beef texture is correct. No stringiness allowed.
3. Timing is everything in stir-fry. Help me stay organized so I don't burn the garlic/ginger.

**Here is the full recipe for your reference:**
