## Option 1: "Everything" Seed-Crusted Chicken
*A high-texture meal leveraging your seed collection for healthy fats and crunch.*

### 📝 Abbreviated Recipe
1. **Prep Veg:** Slice cabbage into 1" thick "steaks". Slice potatoes into thin coins. Toss both in avocado oil/salt and roast at 425°F until tender and browned (~20-25 mins).
2. **Prep Chicken:** Butterfly chicken breasts. Press one side firmly into a mix of **Pumpkin, Sesame, Poppy, and Nigella seeds**.
3. **Cook:** Pan-fry chicken in **Butter** (seed-side down first) until crispy and cooked through.
4. **Finish:** Serve with a side of sliced **Avocado** and a squeeze of lemon/vinegar.

### 🔄 Refinement Paths
- **A: The Dip:** Add a quick "Mustard-Yogurt" sauce for the chicken.
- **B: The Crust:** Add grated **Parmesan** into the seed mix for a savory, cheesy crust.

## Option 2: Creamy Parsley-Garlic Chicken
*Rich, herby, and comforting with a focus on the fresh parsley.*

### 📝 Abbreviated Recipe
1. **Prep Starch:** Boil red potatoes until soft. Drain and smash with **Butter**, a splash of bouillon, and **Parmesan**.
2. **Cook Veg:** Sauté shredded cabbage and onions in **Butter** until "meltingly" soft. Stir in **Fresh Spinach** at the end.
3. **Cook Chicken:** Season chicken breasts and sear in a pan. Remove and make a quick pan sauce with **Garlic, Bouillon, and lots of Parsley**. Stir in a dollop of **Greek Yogurt** for creaminess.
4. **Finish:** Plate the chicken over the mash, drizzled with the herb sauce. Serve with **Avocado**.

### 🔄 Refinement Paths
- **A: The Glaze:** Use **Balsamic Vinegar** instead of white vinegar in the sauce for a darker, sweeter finish.

*A thick, one-pot comfort meal that's very low effort.*

5. **Garnish:** Top with **Nigella Seeds, Pumpkin Seeds**, and fresh **Parsley**.

### 🔄 Refinement Paths
