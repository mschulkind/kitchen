# Meal Plan Options: Shop the Kitchen (Low GI 1:5:5:5)

**Goal:** Hit the 1:5:5:5 ratio (Fiber:Fat:Carb:Protein) using Cabbage, Chicken, and Potatoes.

## Option 1: Roasted Cabbage "Steaks" & Smashed Potatoes with Pan-Seared Chicken
*A "knife and fork" dinner where the cabbage is the star.*
- **Fiber (1):** Cabbage rounds roasted until caramelized + skins on red potatoes.
- **Fat (5):** A rich butter and dill pan sauce for the chicken.
- **Carb (5):** Boiled and then smashed/crisped red potatoes.
- **Protein (5):** Pan-seared chicken breast.

## Option 2: Warm Chicken & Potato Salad with Shredded Cabbage & Radish
*A hearty, voluminous salad using radishes for sharp crunch.*
- **Fiber (1):** Thinly shredded raw cabbage and sliced radishes.
- **Fat (5):** Olive oil and Greek yogurt-based dressing with dill.
- **Carb (5):** Diced boiled red potatoes tossed while warm into the dressing.

## Option 3: Sheet Pan Chicken, Potatoes, and "Melting" Cabbage
*A simple one-pan meal where the cabbage gets soft and sweet.*

- **Carb (5):** Thinly sliced potato coins roasted until crisp.
- **Protein (5):** Herb-rubbed chicken breast strips.

## Option 4: Chicken & Cabbage "Stir-Fry" with Crispy Potato Matchsticks
*A textural play on a classic stir-fry.*
- **Fiber (1):** Quick-sautéed cabbage and celery.
- **Fat (5):** Cooking in butter/oil + a sprinkle of chia/hemp seeds for healthy fats.
- **Carb (5):** Potatoes cut into matchsticks and fried until crispy (acting as the "noodle").
- **Protein (5):** Thinly sliced chicken breast.

## Option 5: Instant Pot Chicken & Potato Stew with Shredded Cabbage Finish
*A comforting, thick bowl.*
- **Fiber (1):** Cabbage stirred in at the very end to maintain bite, plus carrots/celery.

### 🙋 Questions for the Chef:
1. Do you have any **fresh herbs** like parsley or cilantro? (I saw dill in your fridge stock!).
2. Do you have **Mustard** or **Apple Cider Vinegar**? (Great for low-GI dressings).
3. Do you have **Butter** or **Avocado**? (Needed to help hit that "5" in Fat).
4. Do you have any **Nuts/Seeds** (like the hemp/chia in your pantry) for extra fiber/fat?
