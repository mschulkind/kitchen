## Instructions

### 1. Mise-en-place
- Sauté the **onion, carrots, celery, and peppers** in olive oil over medium-high heat in a large pot until softened (5-7 mins).
- Add the **garlic** and spices (basil, oregano, pepper flakes) and cook for 1 min until fragrant.

### 2. The Simmer
- Pour in the **canned tomatoes** (crushing them as you go) and the **broth**.
- Stir in the **rinsed quinoa**. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
- Cover and cook for 10 minutes.

### 3. The Protein
- Stir in the **sliced chicken**. Because it's sliced thin, it will poach in the hot liquid in about 5-7 minutes.

### 4. The Creamy Transformation
- While the chicken cooks, place the **cottage cheese** in a blender (or use an immersion blender) with a splash of the hot stew liquid. Blend until completely smooth.
- Stir the blended cottage cheese back into the pot. It will turn the red sauce into a creamy, pinkish "vodka sauce" style consistency.

### 5. Final Touch
- Stir in the **mixed greens** or **frozen spinach** and cook until wilted (1-2 mins).
- Taste and adjust salt and pepper.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Kid Submeal Pattern
- **The "Plain" Scoop:** Before adding the greens and the blended cottage cheese, scoop out some cooked chicken and quinoa.
- **Serving:** Serve the chicken and quinoa with a little butter and the shredded cheese you have in the fridge.
- **Veggie Side:** Give them raw carrot sticks or bell pepper slices from the prep stage.

## 🌶️ Flavor Layering
- **The Depth:** Use the Beef broth from the freezer for a deeper, more savory "red sauce" vibe. 
- **The Crunch:** Top your bowl with very thinly sliced radishes for a fresh, peppery bite that cuts through the creaminess.
