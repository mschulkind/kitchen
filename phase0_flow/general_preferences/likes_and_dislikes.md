## Kid Meals

My kids are very picky eaters. They like typical kid things like pasta and butter and mac and
cheese. If possible, plan recipes so that some ingredients can be saved partway through like pasta
without sauce on it and can be made into a kid meal. This doesn't have to be for every meal, but
once in a while is nice so we don't have to make a separate meal for the kids.

## Composition

Each meal should have some sort of veggie component. This can be something like pan fried chicken
breasts with roasted brussels sprouts on the side, or a pasta dish with roasted zucchini mixed in.

## Prioritization

Prioritize using ingredients that are perishable that are in the stock lists. Freezer stuff lasts
forever, but veggies in the fridge don't last forever or bread in the pantry has a limited shelf
life.
