# Context Index

This index organizes the `context/` directory, which is gitignored and used for temporary, non-version-controlled content such as research notes, data dumps, API references, and other supporting materials referenced during development. It helps maintain navigability without cluttering the main planning docs.

## Overview
The `context/` directory serves as a scratchpad for exploratory work. Content here is ephemeral and should be summarized or migrated to `plans/` if it becomes permanent. Use clear naming and this index to track items.

## Categories and Content

### Research Notes
- **Placeholder**: Add files like `recipe-algorithms-research.md` for explorations on ingredient optimization or meal planning heuristics.
- **Placeholder**: `llm-integration-notes.md` for prompt engineering experiments or API usage insights.

### API References
- **Placeholder**: `openai-api-ref.md` or similar for LLM provider docs, examples, and rate limits.
- **Placeholder**: `grocery-api-exploration.md` if external services (e.g., for store layouts) are researched.

### Data Dumps
- **Placeholder**: `sample-recipes.json` for test datasets of recipes and ingredients.
- **Placeholder**: `pantry-inventory-samples.csv` for example inventory data.

### Temporary Notes
- **Placeholder**: Quick files like `ux-sketch-ideas.txt` for brainstorming sessions.
- **Placeholder**: Debug outputs or temp calculations (e.g., `ingredient-overlap-analysis.py` outputs).

## Navigation Notes
- All files here are gitignored; do not commit sensitive or temporary data.
- Link back to [plans/index.md](../plans/index.md) for core planning docs.
- When adding new content, update this index with a brief description and relative link (e.g., [file-name.ext](file-name.ext)).
- Clean up obsolete files periodically to avoid bloat.

TODO: Populate as research and temp content is added during development.
